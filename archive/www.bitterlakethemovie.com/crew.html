	Bitter Lake is the first live action full motion picture to be made in the Furry Fandom
			and is the second EZwolf and Shay production to date. Produced entirely by the crew itself
			and sponsored by Eurofurence, Bitter Lake combines the creative skills of a small team of
			enthusiastic and driven people and shows what can be done with minimum resources in a very
			short timeframe. The incredible work done when it comes to camera work, script and story
			writing, music composition, (voice) acting, art and fursuit building is something unique and
			every piece of the puzzle fits. Shot entirely on location in France and the Netherlands in HD
			35 mm.
			</p><p>Bitter Lake premiered at Eurofurence 17 in August of 2011.
			</p>
			<p>
			The DVD has been for sale in Europe and the US but is no longer available.</p>

	Over the last eleven years, Shay has been working as a creative writer and game designer on
			several computer games for PC, iPhone and WP7 and has now tried his hand at script writing
			and movie directing. After the success of Fursuit Theater at Eurofurence 16 (2010) Shay
			started work on a new and slightly bigger challenge; a full motion picture. For the Bitter
			Lake movie project he wrote the underlying story, worked out the script, co-produced with
			EZwolf, voiced the role of Prince Arden of Tolver and the narrator, and sat down in the
			director's chair.</p></a>
<a class="switchhide">
<p>
	EZ started his career as an advertisement photographer in the early nineties and
			became involved in professional video and film producing in 1997. Being a photographer
			and part of the fandom has resulted in many furry related videos and photographic art.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Bitter Lake film project is currently EZ's biggest challenge after having performed
			in the Fursuit Theatre at EF 16 (2010). Next to being co-producer with Shay, EZ is Bitter
			Lakes' director of photography, lighting-cameraman, production designer and editor. EZwolf
			also portrays the role of Colonel Raden Drraer.</p></a>
<a class="switchhide">
<p>
	For 20 of the 25 years of his life, Fox has played Piano. As such it's allowed him
			to travel the world performing in venues such as the Royal Albert Hall, The Cavern
			Club and countless theatres. As a composer he's worked professionally for nearly 5
			years, having done work for Nintendo Wii games, television adverts, and having recently
			joined the Furry Fandom, is now producing the music for it's first full motion picture.
			He's currently released three albums, a fourth due for the Summer entitled "Feel", a
			name derived from the comments he often recieves relating to the known expression he
			puts into his Orchestral and New Age work. He's currently attending the first ever
			year of Scotiacon as Guest of Honour, working on "Myre", a collaborative comic between
			himself and AlectorFencer... and can't function without coffee.</p></a>
<a class="switchhide">
<p>
	Tiger Tom (or more recently known as Malamutt) works in the UK as a software developer.
			During his studies, he worked as a part-time cook in several pubs and pursued his
			interest in photography. Whilst looking for a cook and an EPK photographer the Bitter
			Lake producers took notice of his experience as Confuzzled's official photographer and
			part-time cook and quickly found consensus. So, in between organizing groceries,
			stirring in pots and pans and serving delicious meals, Tom shot almost the entire
			making-of video and all production stills.</p></a>
<a class="switchhide">
<p>
	Rin is the only female crewmember in the Bitter Lake crew but that didn't stop her
			from feeling at home. At the age of five she joined a theater club that presented
			a play each year. She managed to keep doing that till 2006 when she got asked to work
			as an extra in the Dutch movie "In naam van de Vader". Her small stature may fool you,
			but be warned; she is very apt in doing what is asked of her. Next to acting in the
			Bitter Lake movie project, Rin helped a lot with set dressing and cleaning up. She is
			very proud to have been part in what she calls 'this epic undertaking' and has enjoyed
			portraying the role of Belora dan Winters.</p></a>
<a class="switchhide">
<p>
	StoelBank is the youngest person on the team, but is certainly not the most inexperienced
			one. He has held a lot of different jobs and practiced quite a number of hobbies which have
			always fuelled his passion: Creativity. StoelBank is currently studying Visualization in the
			Netherlands and is aiming to become a freelance artist. He has achieved the goals he has set
			for himself by never giving up and pushing through no matter what. StoelBank portrays the
			role of Prince Arden of Tolver in the Bitter Lake movie project, designed the website and
			created the art for the narration scene.</p></a>
<a class="switchhide">
<p>
	Forfaox is currently employed as a software developer in The Netherlands. After setting
			foot into the fandom a few years ago, he quickly took up fursuiting as a hobby and started
			developing an appreciation for the entertainment aspect of it. Every chance he gets, Forfaox
			tries to improve himself in the area of interaction with the public and acting in general.
			When asked if he would like to participate in the Bitter Lake movie project as one of the
			main characters, he didn't have to think twice and took the opportunity. In the movie, he
			portrays the role of Careth Dale.</p></a>
<a class="switchhide">
<p>
	Tillikum got in touch with cameras at a very young age. His dad, a hobby photographer
			taught him the very basics of image composition and he went from there himself.
			</p>
			<p>
			In 2001 he bought his first video camera and started to experiment with moving
			images until he became part of the Eurofurence video team in 2006.
			Getting used to the camerawork that was needed for the Bitter Lake movie project was
			quite the challenge for Tilli, seeing his experience with shooting videos came solely
			from convention or Fursuit-walks in Europe or America. At the end of the shooting days
			it turned out that his previous experiences with camera work helped him more than even
			he thought possible.</p></a>
<a class="switchhide">
<p>
	Nikoshi is an enthusiastic young man who studied camerawork and editing and graduated
			with flying colors in 2010. After the success of the Fursuit Theatre last year, where
			Nikoshi got asked to do the lighting, he got asked by Shay to help him out with his
			newest project: Bitter Lake. Nikoshi's role in the project was purely behind the scenes,
			being not only the best-boy for grip and lighting but also camera assistant to EZ and
			Tillikum. Next to driving the crew back and forth and making sure everyone had freshly
			baked bread every morning, he is also credited for set dresser and visual effects
			supervisor. He said he never felt a true moment of rest until Shay and EZ said it was
			a wrap.</p></a>
<a class="switchhide">
<p>
	With having worked for more than eight years at one of Europe's biggest Broadcast
			Facilities as a Sound technician, Kwisa was the ideal candidate to join the Bitter
			Lake crew. His experience with recording TV shows proved invaluable as he could help
			the crew with setting up camera locations and deal with lighting and grip issues.
			Kwisa joined the Bitter Lake crew to help out with was the recording of on set sound
			and foley and the playback of sound for the actors. Because of his job, Kwisa has
			provided a positive look on furries and fursuiting alike on Dutch television by
			appearing on several TV shows explaining that Fursuiting is more than what most hype
			media make it out to be.</p></a>
<a class="switchhide">
<p>
	Lucy hasn't been in the  fandom all that long, she discovered it some four years ago after
			meeting her partner, Fairlight. She immediately fell for the friendliness of the community,
			the social aspect of doing things together and the cuteness of the suits. She had a lot of
			fun joining Fairlight's PawPet UK team and making many new friends, and was surprised and
			honoured to be asked to voice Belora dan Winters for the Bitter Lake project. She enjoyed
			recording the voice of the tough little dragon from Sinnah tremendously and looks forward to
			seeing the final cut.</p></a>
