Today, the Fursuit list has migrated to a new server and software.  This was
long over due, as the old software simply 
did not keep up with the times.  The new list is behind some very good spam
filtering, and the options to make changes 
to your subscriptions are much better as well.

I will be soon changing the website to send all mail list changes directly
to the list manager software.

You should have gotten an email with your new temporary password for the
mail list.  You may log into the mail list page 
and change your password as deemed fit.

The new list software will also keep web page archives, and deal with
bounces a whole lot better than the old system.

Subscriptions to the list will still be handled the same, requiring
pre-approval..  

At this point, if you are receiving this message, you have been moved to the
new list, in either it's regular or digest 
form.

I will cross my fingers and hope all went well.

This past week I went to Gulfport  Mississippi to help with Katrina Relief. 
They were hit harder than New Orleans  was. At the weeks end I went to 
Jazzfest, and found the coolest picture EVER!  You can buy prints (some seem very 
furry, all are blue dogs) and the proceeds  help rebuild after the hurricane. This 
is something I'm very passionate about,  soo please check it out!

We are  free

All of us are walking through the  world

with purpose in our step.
Sometimes we even abandon  society
only to embrace this Furry  thing
to be  ourselves.
Furry freedom seems to be a very special thing. Perhaps it is  because it 
isn't given to us, but is something we make for ourselves. Perhaps  from a 
position at the edge of society we can easily choose to be "in" or "out"  as we

Subject: FL: Silly question regarding paws
Message-ID: <001c01c672a0$0a7966e0$6501a8c0@chris>

Greetings,

I am in the process of designing my first actual fursuit and I came across something that could be a problem.

I'm planning to have the arms and paws connected to the bodysuit themselves, instead of seperate 'slide on' gloves.

The paws themselves are essentially just going to be mitten style, with one section for the thumb and another section for all four fingers (As opposed to seperate finger sections for each finger).

Basically what I'm wondering is if anyone has experiences with grabbing zippers through paws. I was thinking back, and all of the suits I've worn have had detachable paws and I took them off to get at the zipper.

My main concern is simply that a combination of the decreased flexibility, rigid mitten paws, and inability to grasp things easily would make it impossible for me to get out of alone, which wouldn't be too great.

I'm thinking I should be alright if I install a 'jumbo' zipper which will be hidden by a fur flap; that way it should be easier to grab with the big paws.

So if anybody has any experience or insight, feel free to share. Otherwise I'll probably go ahead and start on construction soon, and hope I can actually get out of it once I've gotten in!

-C

My first suggestion to make that bodysuit fit you well is to make a duct 
tape dummy of yourself. Use that as a dressing dummy and lots of cheap 
muslin to use as your pattern. Rather than bore the list with repeated 
instructions, I'll forward you to the fursuit FAQ's sections 3.3, 6, and 
15. Patternmaking seems to be an individual creation thing, as everyone 
has their own method.

http://www.fursuit.org/faq/index.htm

What I did in the past was one of two ways... First was to cover the dummy 
in saran or plastic wrap, then another layer of tape. Mark where you want 
your seams to be, usually the sides and around the arms, and then cut 
around there. Second way was tracing out a bodysuit I already had one that 
was too big onto the muslin and piece together with safety or straight 
pins. Then from there, just tailor to your fit.

Either that or use commercial patterns, also found in section 6. Some of 
the patterns may be discontinued.

For how long the paw pieces are, it's usually personal preferences as to 
how how high up the paw pieces will go, but much of the time, halfway to 
the elbows and knees. That offers just enough coverage to allow for those 
who pull on you and suits with arms and necks that are a little short.

Wearing it while you make marks on the inside of where to cut can help. 
I've usually had someone wear the head while I make all the adjustments to 
make it fit. If you have a lifecast, it can help if you're just doing it 
by yourself.

I think I remember a thread on something like this. Can someone repost or 
post a URL or two on this?

your question are too "open". ( aparte, mi ingles es malo ).
I don't have any resume, but I read the experiencie form the rest of people.
that is the best way, because you learn before any mistake.

Depend what you looking for

check in  F.A.Q. on Fursuiting Performance and
Construction<http://www.fursuit.org/faq/>
the ftp link: 13pawear.htm
http://www.fursuit.org/faq/13pawear.htm
or the Nicodemus' page
in the other hand
you can take some ideas reading the pdf

making them attached halfway is probably better... that way they won't get 
lost, but you can still wriggle your hand out to get the zipper...

*picturing a furry paw getting stuck in the zipper and having someone call 
911 to get the heat stroke victim's zipper unjammed*

hmmm... yes, definately being able to use your poseable thumbs in conjuction 
with your fingers has advantages...

Why do you want to have the paws connected to the bodysuit, specifically? The paws also don't necessarily have to be slide-on either. There could be snaps or velcro involved for extra security for detachable paws.
   
  Grasping a zipper with paws takes a skillful hand, especially with reduced digits and dexterity. I personally can, but then again, there are a lot of things that are easier sans-paws.
   
  "My main concern is simply that a combination of the decreased flexibility, rigid mitten paws, and inability to grasp things easily would make it impossible for me to get out of alone, which wouldn't be too great."
   
  You are absolutely right, and I say go for the detachable paws because it makes life a whole lot easier. And, like I said, there are other ways to have paws - I have snaps on my paws, I've seen velcro used on paws. Or if you're really crazy about having the paws connected to the bodysuit, have them partially connected so you can still slip your hand out of a hole located on the wrist.

We moved from gloves and suits on our mascot costumes
after we lost hands at some critical times.  What we
do now is sew the top of the hand to the arm of the
suit, and, have sewn a velcro flap to the under neath
that our people can open and close when they're
getting in and out of suit.

Solves the problem of lost hands.

Howdy there!
    I used to have to get in and out of a mascot suit with mitten paws by 
myself, and I found that a loop of shoelace (a long shoelace, so the loop is 
about two feet long) made it easy.  You don't have to be able to grab onto 
the loop, even -- just stick your hand through it and pull it up.  As long 
as the bodysuit isn't too tight-fitting, you can just tuck the loop down 
inside, and pull it out again when you're done suiting.

I have some suits like that. Not too bad but not too good either. I'd reccomend the half-attached paw with a velcro seal. If you want a really good seal at for the hands you can put a zipper on the inside of the wrist. Then you can close it and pop your hand into the glove.

What's the placement of the zipper like? Is it across the wrist or up and 
down like with some opera gloves with buttons?

I think either configuration can work. If there's a bit of length in the sleeve I'd say go longways. If the wrist has a little room around, have the zipper go around.

Subject: FL: Dying with acrylic...
Message-ID: <20060509122134.65983.qmail@web35502.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Currently, I'm trying to dye parts of my fursuit-in-progress with white acrylic (aka, the  underarms, paws, and underside of tail), but I have no clue how to go about it. I tried painting it onto the tail and rubbing it in, along with brushing it so that it didn't mat, but it DID mat, and looked really bad. Thankfully, I washed it out before it completely set. Is there something I'm doing wrong, or not doing at all? Or is white acrylic a bad choice?
   
  I don't have access to anything expensive or unusual for dying, nor do I have time/energy to boil fur, etc. and all of those other many-step ways to go about it that take forever and make messes. Is there a proper technique for dying fur with paint possibly?

yea.... waterthe paint down a LOT, and do it in layers....  you may also
want to try starting with a paint that is a lighter shade of your bass fur
before going to white.

Yes, there was a discussion on this topic of dying faux fur a little while ago, it was recommended to use leather dyes. I believe I was told to use acrylic paints for airbrushing and drybrushing, which I've bought but haven't tried yet.
   
  I only have experience in some drybrushing of minitures and airbrushing in art class at summer camp when I was much younger. I'd like to add a bit more color to my fursuit as well, along with highlights and shading... I'm still working on my first fursuit, it much harder than I had expected... that's with 10 years+ of sewing experience and costuming.

Hi Farron,
We have talked about this a lot on LJ Fursuit. Please look around here:
http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=fursuit&keyword=Painting/Dyeing/Airbrushing&filter=all

Beary Cheap sells something called "Syn-Tint" that Aaron_Raccoon has used
pretty successfully but you have to watch how hot you get the water!!
http://www.bearycheap.com/ezimerchant/prod1294.htm  is the website.

Goodluck!

On my suits I put the zipper in the front, then use the chest piece to 
cover that, the chest piece is just velcro'd shut.. a smaller zipper 
will be hard to use with paws on so I usually tie a string or piece of 
leather cord to the zipper to make it easy to grab hold of..

(Sorry about the million questions! I just want to get my fursuit right the first time!)
   
  I'm wondering if there's a good way to make a tail so that it has that *snap and flick* of a feline tail. I was originally thinking of using a combo of wire and chain (the top part would be chain and be linked to wire at the bottom so that it both supports the tail and gives it that flexibility and mvement). I just don't know if this is the best/easiest way to go about making it realistic....if you have another idea, I'd be more than grateful to hear it! Thanks!

You may want to look at one of those long springs used to close a screen door, it may have the properties you want for a core.

This is just a guess, but what about putting elastic in the tail so that its
connected at the tip and the base, and is just a bit shorter than the tail
itself?  Just a guess, though.

Nice!

heh it's funny over here I've worn 3 different Alex suits.
There was that one from Universal which i wore for movie promos
Then I wore this BAD Alex suit for mall promos. 
http://www.crittercountry.com.au/alex1.jpg
And Then I wore another Alex suit for the stage production 
http://www.crittercountry.com.au/alex2.jpg
*weird huh*

Admittedly the one you wear is by far the best out of the 3.

Thanks for sharing the pics!

Cheers

Oz

Regarding performance as a mascot, has anyone found that taking
classes in stage movement, pantomime or similar improves effectiveness
as a costumed character? If you did, was it helpful? If not, why? I've
been told that I'm okay performer in 'suit. What I'd like to do is
build on that small amount of talent. Any constructive comments would
be appreciated. My apologies for spamming the list if this subject is

I find that my puppetry work plays heavily into the way that I perform costume characters.  Puppetry taught me a ton about expressing feeling and emotions visually, as well as giving me insight into character posture and movement.  Much of what I learned working with hand puppets translated very easily to the full-body character costume.  I also did a little independent study of miming, and would like to do some more, but so far I've not been to any classes on that subject.  

I would strongly recommend studying both subjects, because they are at the core of what costume character performance is all about.  After all, if you think about it, a character costume is just an oversized puppet with the puppeteer on the inside.  And, what one does in performing a silent costume character is almost identical to what a mime does.

A good starting book on puppetry is 'Making Puppets Come Alive', by Larry Engler and Carol Fijan.  You'd be surprised at how many of the lessons in that book can be easily translated from a glove puppet to a costume character.

Just my two bits.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

Heya Speedy

I started mascoting back when i was in high school years back, before i took 
any classes for drama.  I did check out mascot.net  and that  helped a lot, 
as they offered a lot of pointers in their "Acting 101" page.  It was really 
helpful in my opinio.  It wasn't until i was a senoir in HS that i was able 
to take a drama class, and it wasn't exactly the basics, so it didn't help 
all that much.

If you do take a drama class, take the basics that will teach some 
pantamiming.  If you need any more advice, feel free to come to me with any 
questions.  I've been a mascot for about 5 or 6 years total, and am still 
doing it today.  I'd be happy to help you if you need it.

ttyl,
Stormyfox

I've been doing Jazzercise on a regular basis since November 2000.  It not only gives you a cardiovascular workout, there is strengh training, balance, coordiation and stretching.  Plus you learn a lot of dance moves, so it's great to be able to dance in suit whenever there is music playing.  It has also helped me with my perfornamces with the RAGGS Kids Club (www.raggs.com).  I got so in to it, I became a certified Jazzercise instructor last June and teach 4 days a week.  I have three fellow costume performers who take my classes. Classes are held in all 50 states and internationally, so to find a class, go to www.jazzercise.com.

Simply.

Yes, any classes you can take will help with your
performance.  If nothing else, it will help challenge
your improv abilities. 

I find the biggest thing about performance is being
able to react quickly on your feet to any situation
that's presented to you.

As well, it's important to develop your character
traits.

I'm a trained dancer and performance artist, so I know how to move my body
in extra diverse ways, which come in handy when lugging around in a
sometimes heavy costume.

Training does help, I'll grant that.

Hmm, that's interesting. Especially the puppetry aspect. I'll check
out that book. Thanks Mr Fox.

I've been doing mascoting for about four years. At first just stuff
for free with my own costumes. But recently I've started to take on a
lot of paid work. Comments on jobs has always (knock on wood..) been
very positive. But I still feel the need to improve on what I can do.
Thanks for your suggestions. I appreciate them. I may take you up on a
question or two in the near future:)

I too started out as a puppeteer on my TV show before I branched out into mascot performing as a result of that.  If you look at creations such as Big Bird and Bear in the Big Blue House, those are really more puppets that you "wear" instead of just costumes.

I find that my puppetry work plays heavily into the way that I perform costume 
characters.  Puppetry taught me a ton about expressing feeling and emotions 
visually, as well as giving me insight into character posture and movement.  
Much of what I learned working with hand puppets translated very easily to the 
full-body character costume.  I also did a little independent study of miming, 
and would like to do some more, but so far I've not been to any classes on that 
subject.  

I would strongly recommend studying both subjects, because they are at the core 
of what costume character performance is all about.  After all, if you think 
about it, a character costume is just an oversized puppet with the puppeteer on 
the inside.  And, what one does in performing a silent costume character is 
almost identical to what a mime does.

A good starting book on puppetry is 'Making Puppets Come Alive', by Larry Engler 
and Carol Fijan.  You'd be surprised at how many of the lessons in that book can 
be easily translated from a glove puppet to a costume character.

Just my two bits.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

Gotcha. From day one my approach to 'suiting has been
character-driven. Now when I'm booked for a job I try to find out as
much about the personality of the costume I'll be wearing as I can.
I'm okay at reacting to and creating a scene out of an existing
enviroment. But I can see that I could also use alot improvement as
well.

An improv class would be challenging to me given my RL personality.
But I can also see that it would really go a long way towrd helping me
give a more convincing performance.

Thanks!

That's very interesting that you should mention Jazzercise. The job I
did this past Saturday had some elements of that in it. I really liked
the dance moves. That was really fun. Most of the dancing in costume I
do is club/trance stuff. Which really means you can do anything you
want. Some structure and technique would be very helpful. I'll check
it out. Thanks!

Subject: FL: sewing loose pawpads back onto paws
Message-ID: <BAY108-F29C6BDC69F200D303A1DC1B3AF0@phx.gbl>

HI,
was looking over a costume I have to wear for an upcoming gig and I noticed 
the pawpads on the palms of both paws were starting to come unstitched.  
anyone know a good trick to get them sewn back on? the paws are impossible 
to turn inside out due to the fur and lining fabric.

Howdy all

Okay, here is a question for everyone out there.

When you are in your suit and doing active things, what type of helmets and 
head restraints / chin straps do you use?

Hockey helmet with a basic snap on chin strap? - fits nice but tendency to 
unsnap
Hockey helmet with a velcro on chin strap? - fit is bleh but stays on better 
than the snap
Hockey helmet with the straps looped around the ear guards? - fits around 
throat, beneath chin but hasn't come off yet

Thats what Ive seen and worked with but Im curious what else is out there or 
what ideas you all have come up with.  What worked and what didn't work?

See, I told you you should have bought that puppet you saw in Ocean City 
last year *GRIN*.

You already are pretty good in costume by the way.

"No sweaty fursuit"

As a veteran mascot of a cold climate.. Trust me.. Yah
still sweat when it snows. Yah still sweat when you're
doing hockey games in Arenas. 

And, I don't know how many times I've done events like
christmas parades, only to finish, take off the suit,
and, find myself with a cold a few days later.  You're
so sweaty, then, you're jumping into cold clothes. 

Fun.  Suiting in cold weather has a whole lot of
different occupational hazards. :)

Well, what you could do is take hot glue and line the outside of the pad (the part that should be sewn in) and press it and the fur together until it's dry. But keep in mind that you should make sure that there is fur enought to overlap the seam and hide it if it doesn't look good. (If you use hot glue for putting the fur together on the mask, then just use the same technique).
   
  You could also use a very small spiral stitch, but first fold the pad part (again, the lining that's supposed to be sewn in), and bend it underneath the paw. (Sorry about the explanation; you have to see it to truly understand). In other words, fold the lining of the pad beneath itself so that it looks the way it should when it's done. Then take the needle and stick it into the fold and back into the fur, using the spiral stitch which is naturally not obvious and is strong.
   
  Hope this could help! Good luck!

I'm just using a bike helmet, with the head built around that, the
straps work quite well.  And I'm able to secure the head to the helmet
with out drilling holes in the helmet.

I also forgot to mention that doing Jazzercise has really helped my endurance in suit. Having good balance and flexibility was also a plus.  Example:  When I perform at a local kids' amusement park, I go on the rides with the kids.  When I was on the carousel, my horse stopped in the highest position at the end of the ride.  It was a challenge to get off of the horse.  My leg ended up being stretched very far while trying to get off and I had to balance on the other leg at the same time.  There are routines in Jazzercise that require you to work one leg while standing on only one foot at a time.  
 
There is a coupon on the Jazzercise website for a free week of classes.  You should definitely give it a try!

That's very interesting that you should mention Jazzercise. The job I
did this past Saturday had some elements of that in it. I really liked
the dance moves. That was really fun. Most of the dancing in costume I
do is club/trance stuff. Which really means you can do anything you
want. Some structure and technique would be very helpful. I'll check
it out. Thanks!

Yeah, use a needle a thread - actually I use quilting thread for "stressed" areas and foot paws - it holds up 10x better than just high quality thread. - unless you want to do a lot of work and double or triple up on normal thread to make your foot paws more durable and firm. Anyhow - Use needle and thread. I personally don't like hot glue on paws because eventhing I've hot glued on my paws have come un-stuck after the stress of walking a few miles in them.
   
  Anyhow - good luck! - I need to get started on another set of my own footpaws and paws. :)

	OOC:
	MONKAYA:  Hel-gro fursuit list!
	-
	1 - Paint:
	^^^^^^^^^^
	I used water base paint diluted with cold tap water
to paint black and white stripes onto my gray fur
(pictures online @ "Monkaya's Gallery' - link below). 
each solution apllied with paint brush.
	As paint dried, I intermitantly raked fur with tooth
brush and nail to seprate hairs.
	Result:  some matting of pleasing character enhancing
fur markings!
	CAUTION:  protect area below painting area with
plastic! (as with completed fur shirts)
	____

	2 - Securing Heads:
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	-- ATTACHED:  'Monkaya Section.jpg'
	-
	My head is entered from the back.  My nose and chin
fit snuggly in face plate, held securely by strap on
back of neck.
	this method is likely NOT compatable with commercial
'one size fits all' mascot fursuit heads.

Hi There

Wiki is good except.  It makes it very difficult to download the article (or
FAQ) as a whole. One has to be online at all times to read and review.

Many varieties of wiki come with (or have a plugin for) the ability to
download an article in PDF format.  Assuming you have the rights on
your server to install GS and other software (and it runs Linux).

Hi all

Something I have done a couple of times and it seems to work well on
stitching.

There is a product that all I know of is called  ?liquid insulation?. Is a
liquid available in several colors that you can dip tool handles in to give
them am insulated coating.

When I stitches the fur to my hand paws I carefully painted this stuff on
the stitches and it dried giving a flexible but very tough protective seam
on the stitches. This could stop them from fraying due to normal wear and
tear.

Hope it helps

Marcwolf

Yeah, use a needle a thread - actually I use quilting thread for "stressed"
areas and foot paws - it holds up 10x better than just high quality thread.
- unless you want to do a lot of work and double or triple up on normal
thread to make your foot paws more durable and firm. Anyhow - Use needle and
thread. I personally don't like hot glue on paws because eventhing I've hot
glued on my paws have come un-stuck after the stress of walking a few miles
in them.
?
Anyhow - good luck! - I need to get started on another set?of my own
footpaws and paws. :)

Well, what you could do is take hot glue and line the outside of the 
pad (the part that should be sewn in) and press it and the fur together 
until it's dry. But keep in mind that you should make sure that there is 
fur enought to overlap the seam and hide it if it doesn't look good. 
(If you use hot glue for putting the fur together on the mask, then just 
use the same technique).
?? 
? You could also use a very small spiral stitch, but first fold the pad 
part (again, the lining that's supposed to be sewn in), and bend it 
underneath the paw. (Sorry about the explanation; you have to see it to 
truly understand). In other words, fold the lining of the pad beneath 
itself so that it looks the way it should when it's done. Then take the 
needle and stick it into the fold and back into the fur, using the spiral 
stitch which is naturally not obvious and is strong.
?? 
? Hope this could help! Good luck!

The current FAQ would probably be kept around for archive purposes,  
however, keeping the FAQ current is not working out, since it  
requires one person to do any updates to it.  a WIKI can do immediate  
updating, by the members of the list..  The mail list is good for  
info, the wiki lets people make this information available to  
others.  My thoughts are that the WIKI will be made public for  
viewing, as the FAQ is, but members only will be allowed to make  
changes to it.

Check wal-mart's toy area in the modeling area, there's a compressor with airbrush
for $55 bucks. Yes its cheap but it does the job ;)

Hi 

Buy a small Home Improvemt Compressor with pressure control and water seperator in addition.
Last one i saw here was in supermarket with 8 bar and 50 liter pot for 39 euro
Plus some adapters for your Airbrush device.

On top with that you even can do sandblasting in a small way

Regards

Atalon

Just a sugggestion; have you considered using http://www.wikia.com/
for the wiki (like the furry wiki) instead of setting up your own? It
probably won't allow for as much control over who edits it, but its
most likely more than good enough and much easier to set up.

These are the plans to instruct you on how to build a mascot head fan 
that incorportes ice packs.

I bought the pre-made product and that was about $64, including 
shipping.  I used the "buy it now" option.  I don't know if he has 
anymore available, but he may in the future.

Hi Minnie

Ok - some big question..

Does it really work,  How long do the batteries last,  how long till you
have to change the ice packs

It looks interesting but I can see some possible issues with how well it
works.

The icepack does look rather small and I am not sure how long it will last
in warmer weather.

Also one is relying on how much airflow one is able to get over the icepack
and there is also the condensation issue because you are taking warm moist
air that has possibly been in your lungs and cooling it. Hence the moisture
will be condensating out onto the iceback and its battteries/fan/holder.


I once saw a geat ides of using ducting fans for fursuit heads.. I hinte
BigBadWolf did something along these lines (bit busy to do the look yo)

If that was the case then a combination of his idea and this mugh work
better plus have the capacity of longer cooling.

Get 2 sheets of reticulated foam over a larger icepack.

Out the icepack between them

Put a non pourous covering over this so that ait can only enter in from one
ent.. and have the other end conntected to the fan area inlet.  Aternative
have the fand at the inlet end and have the outlet connected to the duct.

The effect you want to achive is to push or draw the air throught the foam
and then into a duct leaving to your head (or other parts of the body.

                       ----------------------------------------------------
                        Foam   Foam Foam  Foam  Foam
    Hot Air -->      Icepack Icepack Icepack Icepack     --->  Fan  --->
Ducting or area to be cooled
                        Foam   Foam Foam  Foam  Foam
                        ----------------------------------------------------


The key is to get the largest cool surface area for the air to pass over.

Oh - I know that some of you will immediately thigs of the solid state
cooling systems in portable fridges/cpus etc.. they draw a lot of power and
unless you want to be toting tons of batteries around.. They won't work
well.   Also they have 2 sides to them a cold side and a hot side you will
need heatsinking.

With the above the icepack will take in the head and convert the heat into
energy to turn ice into liquid. When the temperature differential between
the icepack and the outside air is equalised no more heat will be absorbed
and the effect stops.  The solution - change icepack regulairly :>


Hope this help and please minne..  Let us kow how the professional one
works.

Also, if you want to run several brushes, you can make your own manifold for like 5$ in parts. I would suggest a 60-100$ compressor-home depot has em, also many are silent. 
The water trap is essential. Higher CFM is good as well. 

Actually if you go to Harbor Freight, you can get airbrushes for a fraction of the price in the stores as well. It depends if you want to cover large areas or just fine detail. Try ebay for the detail brushes, Harbor Freight for large coverage.

Just one double action brush for now:) I've got a Badger.
I did find a compressor at Harbor for 45.00. It includes a trap and a
regulator. I'll try it and return it if it's noisy/doesn't work for
me. This is cool since I can use it for my regular work too:)
Thanks for the reccommendos.

We will be gathering for furry Bowling at Johnson?s Duckpin Lanes in Hamden, 
CT at 2:15pm on Saturday May 27th.   (Directions Below)

Our bowl time has been booked for 3-5pm and the price per person for the 2 
hours will be $7.00 since we are bringing a group.  Shoes may be extra if 
furs out of suit need them.  We will gather in the lot or lobby prior to 
going on the lanes.

For those in suit please be sure your outfits are family friendly and that 
your tails do not drag on the floor (trip hazard).  We will need to check 
with the desk before changing into suit.

Right now the bowling center is expecting 15 of us and I will need to update 
them if the number grows.  If are attending please send an RSVP to 
Wallyfox98 at hotmail.com.  Please indicate weather or not you are bowling 
in fursuit.

Dinner is likely to follow after the meet.

If anyone is coming from far away and needs a place to crash I do have space 
for the weekend.  Please private email me.  I have a small apartment and can 
only accommodate 2-3 furs.\

Directions are below

To me this looks like the icepack may restrict the airflow rather than make
it cooler.
I've had an experience with a badly placed fan in a suit. I don't have any
suits of my own (yet), but I've done many appearance for my Barnes & Noble
(who gets their costumes from Costume Specialists) and the Peter Rabbit
costume had a newly installed fan. However the fan was placed right up
against the edge of the inside of the mask, which was made of fiberglass,
and because there was nowhere for the fan to pull air FROM, (or exhaust to,
I couldn't tell which way the fan was pointed really and all the ventalation
was at the top of the mask, nowhere near the fan) it provided no help
whatsoever... I couldn't even feel the air moving in the mask at all. Heh.
Back to lurking fer me!

I still have found that fans aren't a particularly
great thing.  I did a 4 hour appearance yesterday,
and, tried a new cooling configuration....  Apart from
pouring water over my head and down my back (which
worked wonders!), we all used balaclava's for the
first time.  The results were not only no sweat
running into our eyes (as it covered our foreheads),
but, were also able to soak the hoods in cold water
then ring them out, and, then put them on under the
heads.  Granted, they were back to room temperature
after a short period of time, the cooling effects were
well worth it.

The FAQ is the old FAQ converted to WIKI layout, allowing FL members  
to make and add changes, keeping the FAQ up to date and more dynamic.

the Directory spot is for people to sort of make a photo directory..   
To help put a name with a face.

The WIKI is now open to all FL members for editing now..   To access  
the editing features, you must log into the "Private" Fursuit pages  
via  http://fursuit.org/private    On that page you will find a link  
to log into the WIKI, and once logged in, you will be able to make  
changes.

Have fun!

Wow, what a year!  It's nice to end my three-year stint as con chair on such 
a high note.  Highlights from the convention follow...


***Thank You***

First off, a big thank you to our Guests of Honor: Bill Holbrook, Ryan "Tet" 
Dewalt, and Candi "Trixi" Dewalt--for attending our convention, allowing us 
to spotlight their creativity and service, and for tirelessly providing the 
memorable gifts we pass on to our highest donors--you make the convention 
possible.  When you read feedback forms that comment the best thing about 
the convention was "Bill, Trixi, and Tet", you know you made the right 
decision!

Thank you to Ferrets Unlimited Ferret Shelter of Cleveland Ohio, for 
providing a valuable and worthy service to the Ohio area, and for sending a 
representative to the convention to help educate our attendees about ferrets 
as pets and companions.  We raised a grand total of $566 for this year's 
charity, and will be sending the check off to the ferret shelter early next 
week.  Thanks so much to all those who donated art and memorabilia to our 
events, to the fursuiters who donated a dance at our pet sale, and to those 
of you who bid on art and purchased raffle tickets in our events.  I'm sure 
the ferrets thank you too!

Special thanks to our Hypertrophes this year: Frazzle 626, Jewel, Ramseys, 
Tamaria, Trickster, and Woyro.  The Hypertrophe donor level was a new idea 
for us, and it seems to have been very successful.  Also, a special thanks 
to Bear for his generous donations of equipment and supplies--in particular, 
a label printer that really sped up registration this year.

Thanks to all of our staff and volunteers, without whom nothing could be 
done at all, much less a convention.  And thanks as well to our attendees 
and donors, of course; what's a convention with nobody to visit it?


***Official Numbers***

We had 187 attendees this year, up from 158 the previous year.  This met 
with our expectations for growth almost exactly, and this is the first year 
in which Morphicon Corporation's income has actually exceeded our costs.

This is proof that, with the selfless dedication of volunteers and generous 
support from donors, a convention can give back a quality experience to all 
who attend.  Our hospitality suite was bigger than ever, and we had a steady 
supply of food, confectionaries, and beverages for all three days--including 
hot meals.  We basically fed the convention.  :)


***Feedback***

Most of the feedback we have received has been very positive.  We are 
continuing to review feedback for the convention on the Morphicon mailing 
list, and the feedback forms themselves.

Once again, there was a lot of positive response for our incredible 
hospitality suite and free food events.  The mature programming track was 
again popular, with many of the panels crowded with participants.  Several 
people have remarked on the respectful nature of our mature panelling, as 
well as the fact that the popular panel discussions are often unavailable at 
other conventions.

This year we were able to correct three big problems from last year.  First, 
we had a full-time headless room.  Second, we had internet service all con 
(though slow at times).  Third, there was increased signage to lead the way 
to registration, and message board availability (as well as daily 
newsletters).

One problem from last year that was not completely addressed this year was 
the problem of our room block being spread out over different areas rather 
than being contiguous.  The hotel was supposed to have corrected this error, 
and we will discuss it with our contact during negotiations for 2007.

Issues we noted this year that will definitely be corrected in 2007:

* Coffee in the hospitality room!  This was missed.
* Credit card readers at registration, for when PayPal is too slow.

Other issues are currently being discussed on the mailing list.


***The Future***

I'm happy to leave the convention in the capable hands of Craig Smith (aka 
Max Goof / Stargazer), the 2007 Convention Committee Chairperson.  Our 
staffing and other critical decisions for next year will be made in about a 
month.

The theme for the 2007 convention has already been announced: "Technofurs"! 
We'll cover topics such as: furries in cyberspace, sci-fi, transhumanism, 
futuristic furries, and more.  Tentatively we are scheduled for May 11-13, 
2007 at the same hotel.  Our hotel negotiations are ongoing, however, so 
we'll make a formal announcement soon when we know the exact date and 
location (along with the Guests of Honor for 2007).

To fill in more variety, our infamous prescripted Furry Variety Show will 
probably be changing names to "Morphicon Spectacle of Doom", and we'll be 
adding a new, more traditional FVS on Sunday evening--one where anyone can 
do a skit without previous directorial approval (as long as it's PG).  This 
should fill in the gap in performance felt by amateur performers who want to 
do their own act that may not be on theme or accepted by the Spectacle of 
Doom, but their act is too long or otherwise not appropriate for our judged 
Masquerade.

Finally, the Morphicon, Morphicon Staff, and Morphicon FVS mailing lists are 
all changing to a new groups system.  The changeover will take place 
sometime within the next month or so.  The Morphicon staff email addresses 
will also be changing.  The website update should cover these issues in 
detail when it comes, again within the next month.

Thanks for your support, everyone.  Morphicon Corporation's events continue 
to thrive because of selfless volunteers and attendees like you.

Anna Wolf (a.k.a. Trickster)

Awesome! a Wiki for us!

I have never played with a Wiki, but I noticed some of the links that went
to a .htm within the old faq didn't get brought over.

Someone asked me about the Tutorial I did for the Duct Tape Dummy and it
looks like it never got brought over.  I am not sure if the other
tutorials I wrote got brought over as I havent had time to go look.

I sent you an email about this too so maybe it could be pointed correctly?

Yep. Should some of the graphics files be stored right on the wiki or 
stored elsewhere, a clickable link? I'm going to be uploading some of 
those files since I still have all of them here on the local computer.

I still got that also here. I might make an offsite link to it just to 
make it easier at the moment.

I looked through it and it looks great so far! I can't wait to see this
grow with people's tutorials and what not.

I have a request if its not too much of a pain.

In case people go straight to the front page (or maybe ANY page?), could
you add a "Log In" button? Maybe on page http://www.fursuit.org/wiki/

Also it seems to be running EXTREMLY slow (Checked with another person
too)  Is that because so many people happen to be looking at it?

The duct tape dummy I ported over manually this afternoon.

There are other pictures, but I was too burned out over the general migratioin to 
deal with it, and I'm sure others can figure it out.  The pictures are all still in 
the old FAQ, see: http://fursuit.org/faq/

I originally took that out to secure it from outside login attempts..  but I think I 
managed to keep it secure.  So now there is a login button on the bottom of every 
screen.

there was a bunch of traffic this afternoon that slowed things down..  not 
specifically to fursuit.org.

Does anyone know where the cheapest place to get a taxidermy wolf jawset? I've checked around the web, but most of them are in the $30-40 range. Any ideas?

Oh yeah, and does anyone know of a good (and CHEAP) place to purchase fur, preferably shag/long pile? I don't really care if the stuff is top-quality or 'the best', but I do need to order fur that will at least be 'good' quality and be inexpensive. Again, same with the jawsets, most places I've checked out are expensive, and range from $20-50, and I'm aiming to spend only between $5-15 per yard, the less the better. I also looked on ebay, but I didn't see anything. Can someone help?

That?s where I got mine too

When I got mine the tongue is set in a snarl format. The brand is Mohr

What I did was snip the under base section off and then put it in a oven at
about 180c for 10 mins. Then put it between 2 heavy books as a press.

The effect is that the tongue flattened out perfectly and looks really
great. 

The pictures are half way down this page

http://www.marcwolf.org/construct/realism/index.html

However I can see from their catalogue that you can get a resting tongue
which would make things easier.

Many people have mentioned how real Marc's jaw looks and Kid always want to
touch his teeth and tounge.  It helps is I puff hot breath onto their
fingers when they do that too :>

Take Care

Marcwolf

The fur I used for my suit was 16 dollars and some change, I got it from the
local Hancock Fabrics.  They didn't have the color I wanted on hand, so they
had to special order it for me, for them having to special order it, I
didn't think that 16 dollars/yard was bad at all.

I usually get fur that's $20-$25 per yard, but since I get it at
Fabric Depot, I just wait until they're having one of their 40% off
sales, so it ends up being about $12-$15 per yard.  Pretty good for
the good stuff.

Subject: FL: Saint Louis Pide Weekend!
Message-ID: <BAY116-DAV2B6CFB652659B31655C61D8A60@phx.gbl>

Just a little over a month until the Saint Louis Pride Festival and Pride 
Parade June 23-25, 2006! We are once again planning a weekend of fun and 
frivolity for everyone. This event is open to everyone and most things are 
relatively kid friendly.  On the agenda for this year...



Friday June 23 - We will head out for a bite of dinner for those that arrive 
earlier in the day. The we will have an evening of fun activities planned as 
everyone arrives at Sunset Lanes for Cosmic Bowling. Fursuits are welcome!



Saturday June 24 - Everyone gets to sleep in a bit and then we will stop by 
our fav Furry coffee shop Mokabe's for a bite of breakfast and then off to 
the Festival for the afternoon. After the festival you have some time on 
your own for the zoo, parks, museums, whatever.



At 6pm we will all meet up for the Pride Potluck. Rules are as follows:

Bring something for yourself to throw on the grill

Bring a side dish to share (salad, casserole, etc) this should be enough for 
4-5 people

Lemonade will be provided, bring your fav beverage if you want something 
different

Chips, cups, plates, plastic ware and napkins will be provided. Alcohol is 
ok to bring, please just keep yourself under control!



Sunday June 25 - Parade Day!!! - It's an early start this morning. We will 
be getting up, grabbing a bite at Hardee's for breakfast and then heading 
over to the staging area for the parade (we have to get there early to avoid 
road closure and avoid parking issues)  The parade kicks off at 11am and 
will go till about 1pm. This is June, so plan on it being HOT! Make sure and 
bring yourself water bottles and such. We will have a large jug of water at 
the staging site and bottles of water at the Festival (end of the parade)



This year's theme is Pride Without Prejudice.  Both the Bad Dog Saloon and 
Cheap Trx are going with these themes. The Cheap TRX entry is going to have 
a western feel to it (Think Brokeback Mountain) and the Bad Dog Saloon will 
be a canine/lupine/vulpine themed entry. Everyone is encouraged to wear 
fursuits, ears, tails or whatever you are so inclined.



After the parade we will be heading to Chris's for a bite of lunch and to 
cool down and relax before everyone heads out.



I need R.S.V.P.'s for the weekend as soon as possible so we can make the 
appropriate plans. We have VERY limited crash space, but I do have rooms 
available at the just remodeled Red Roof Inn that is right by the Big Blue 
House for $73 a night. If you are planning on marching or Fursuiting in the 
parade please let me know what you will be attired in so I can match you up 
with the respective group (we are going to be next to each other in the 
parade hopefully) Also if you are coming to the Potluck on Saturday night, 
please let me know what you are bringing to share so we don't end up with 5 
things all the same!



Please let me know as soon as you can if you are attending to 
tygrcwby at hotmail.com  !!

Howdy all

Recently, while performing as an inflatable character, I had a chance to 
check out their fan system and it was really neat.  A white square,6inches x 
6inches, laying flat against the side of the suit, with a snail fan inside, 
and one side of the square had holes which allowed the fan to blow into the 
suit, but at the same time, it took up nearly no space at all, maybe 1.5 
inches from the suit wall.

Also, it was run off of a 9.6volt rechargeable battery system, that fit into 
a small backpack/buttpouch.  Really neat idea, and I was able to stay out 
for up to an hour.  Then a quick recharge, and we were off and running 
again.

Does anyone have any ideas where something like this could be purchased? 
There were no names at all on the insides of the suit, so I cant call the 
manufacturer and ask them.

Thanks!
- Lucky Dog

Hi Lucky,

I've recently seen several and worked with inflatable costumes that
were made by these folks:
http://www.imcmascots.com/gallery.asp#
I have no idea if they will help source parts for you. But it can't
hurt to ask, right?
The description of the battery pack sounds like the version that IM
uses in their conventional costumes as well. They are good. I've never
had one die on me (crosses paws).
Good luck! But that's in your name...

Single Speedy!

I've been trying to find 14-count black plastic mesh/canvas to replace 
some eyes in a fursuit head.  All I can find is clear or white in the 
14-count.  Occasionally I can find 7-count in black, but that's too 
big.  I've tried looking online without any success.  Places like 
Michael's or JoAnn do not have it.  It used to be everywhere.  Now it's 
almost non-existant!  Anyone out there who would know where to get it?

If you're in the Ohio area, try Pat Catan's? Not sure
if their website has an online store or not. There's
also Hobby Lobby, might be of some use.

 I can no longer find this either, so what I do now is use the plasti-dip black spray on the clear plastic canvas. Spray lightly till covered. If you spray too much on the canvas, you can remove the coated holes with a can of air. It seems that that my local store no longer carry it. I used to get it at Tall Mouse. Good Luck.

If you spray too much on the canvas, you can remove the coated holes with a can of air. It seems that that my local store no longer carry it. I used to get it at Tall Mouse. Good Luck.

Subject: FL: Plastic mesh/canvas


I've been trying to find 14-count black plastic mesh/canvas to replace 
some eyes in a fursuit head.  All I can find is clear or white in the 
14-count.  Occasionally I can find 7-count in black, but that's too 
big.  I've tried looking online without any success.  Places like 
Michael's or JoAnn do not have it.  It used to be everywhere.  Now it's 
almost non-existant!  Anyone out there who would know where to get it?

Minnie

Greetings there!
  I've just been informed by a friend of mine that Roco the Vixen from
Japan will be making her first US Furrycon appearance at AC this year!
Here is the message I received, and so I thought it best to pass it on
to the list to give furrs a heads up on a furry visitor! Pictures of
Roco are in the link provided in the message below. Have fun!!

version of that.

(I'm not a member, so I can't do it myself, but I still want to help and stuff! =^.^=) Anyways, there's a site called wolftronix.com (http://www.wolftronix.com/) and it's been mentioned for making animatronic tails in the FAQ, but it also has a great how-to for making animatronic ears as well, and I noticed that the Wiki is missing a link for that. If you scroll down, you can see the journal for the ears: http://www.wolftronix.com/head/index.html
   
  Also, for animatronic eyes: http://www.wolftronix.com/eyes/index.html
   
  There are several videos around for anyone who wants to see the finished product, too...they're thrown all around the site. Plus there are a couple of testing ears and eyes, along with tail tests.
   
  I don't know whether you need the owner's permission or not, but I just wanted to mention these links for anyone who is working on improving the FAQ section...
                               M
  Hope I could help! =^,^

Subject: FL: FC2007: Fur Your Eyes Only - May Mission Briefings
Message-ID: <20060530233959.GA22890@urocyon.critter.net>


Come celebrate the world of espionage with us in '007. Tuxedo clad spies,
evil-geniuses, femme fatales, mad scientists, super-weapons, and henchman
abound as Further Confusion delves into a world of anthropomorphic Spies,
Spooks, and Double Agents. With special themed events and panels, FC2007
will be a world where nothing is as it seems on first glance, with surprise
lurking around every corner.

In this briefing: 
- FC2007 Charitable Beneficiaries Selected
- FC2006 Charities Paid
- Online Hotel Reservations Available
- FC2007 Dealers Room and Furry Market Place Waiting Lists
- FC2007 Pre-registration Available

                       ----------------------------

- FC2007 Charitable Beneficiaries Selected

Further Confusion 2007 is pleased to announce that the following two
organizations will benefit from our event.  Golden State Greyhound
Adoption (<http://www.goldengreyhounds.com/>) and Stanislaus Wildlife Care
Center (<http://www.stanislauswildlife.org/>).


- FC2006 Charities Paid

We are also delighted to report that the charitable beneficiaries for
FC2006 have received the following funds: Wildlife Companions ($12,000)
Comic Book Defense Fund ($3,000). That's a new yearly record for FC and
two more worthy groups would be hard to find.


- Online Hotel Reservations Available

Online Reservation for booking your hotel rooms is now available at the
following URL:

  <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/book_room.php>

We always run out of space - especially so for Double Rooms - so book
early. Not to mention it helps the con pay for itself just as much as your
registration fee does.


- FC2007 Dealer's Room and Furry Market Place

In August, we will be selecting at random people from the Dealer's Room
waiting list to be offered 10 half-tables for FC2007. In order to be
included in the selection, you should have your waiting list form sent in by
August 1st, 2006. Please allow sufficient time for the USPS to deliver it
to us by that date. There will be a second round of random drawing from the
waiting list in November for any additional table space that is available at
that time. Further Confusion staff continue to work on a revised system of
space allocation in the Dealer's Room for FC2008, and will communicate this
once it has been finalized.

The first round of 10 Furry Market Place spaces will be sold on a first
come, first served basis also starting on August 1st, 2006. Those
interested will need to send in an application form by mail postmarked no
earlier than August 1st - any earlier postmarks will be placed at the back
of the list. The first round will end September 15th. No e-mail
applications will be accepted. The application form will be made available
on the website in June. 

The second round of spaces in the Furry Market Place will be sold starting
in November, again first come, first served, and a third round (if spaces
are still available) will take place at-con. You should note that those who
missed a spot in the first round will NOT have their application
automatically carried over to the second round. The cost of the Furry
Market Place spaces is currently being finalized, and we will let everyone
know what this will be as soon as possible.

Application forms for space in the Dealer's Room and Furry Market Place, as
well as rules governing each area, can be found at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/dealers.php>. Please e-mail
dealers at furtherconfusion.org if you have any questions.


- Pre-Registration

Pre-registration for FC2007 is available on-line at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/registration.php>. Rates are $40 for
the entire convention, and you may either register on-line, or print out a
registration form and mail it to us with payment. The web page also gives
details of some of the goodies you'll get if you register at the Sponsor
($100+) or Patron ($200+) level. Patrons and Sponsors may also claim back
part of their payment on their taxes as a charitable donation. Please
e-mail registration at furtherconfusion.org if you have any questions.


Please eat this briefing after reading.

In short, if you're on the list, you've got access to the Wiki for reading 
*AND* editing. I'm currently editing it in places to make it look better. 
It's a whole different sort of setup, this Wiki. I'm taking notes as I go.

Last I heard from Wolftail, owner of Wolftronix, he said that he's not 
taking commissions at the moment. That may have changed.

Thanks; I didn't know that about. I've already started working on pages that aren't already made yet and I haven't any experience working with wiki, but the setup seems to be agreeing with me. At first I didn't get some stuff but I've gotten the hang of it. If you have any tips, I'd love to know! ^_^

Need more info?  Contact Taha and he'll get you set.

We're also looking for your MFM memories.   If there's a special moment that you remember, type up a paragraph about it and send it to Tahamaki - it might just make it in the book.


*****
"The Flea Collar Comedy Tour" will make its debut at MFM this year.  If you would like to try your paws/hands/talons/etc. at doing a 5-10 minute routine, contact Taha and he'll get you on the list.

*****
Writing Track:

I'm arranging more events! In addition to the existing ones (Meet & Greet, Iron Author, Art of Alliteration), we have Phil Geusz planning to give a talk on Writing Action and host a get-together for members of the TSA story-writing list. Also waiting to hear from Kamau, Sly Rabbit, Chaka Wolf and Dokino, who've each said they're interested in  running an event. This could be quite a busy track depending on who responds, but in any case it looks like we'll have a respectable set of offerings for the con.

-Kris

*****
Video Room:

The Video Room will once again be taking requests from the MFM website all year long, so be sure to vote for your favorite Furry Videos!  As in past years we'll be showing your favorite films, clips and shorts from 10 am to 2 am, so there will be lots of Furry Film
goodness for you to enjoy!

*****
The Variety Show is back and better than ever... well, that of course will have to be seen.  This being the Tenth year of MFM, anyone that can work either Tin or Aluminum (which is the traditional gift for a 10th anniversary) into their act and make it work will get a special award.  The act's don't have to have that in there, but it would just be something fun to try to work on.  Other than that, we will have a great show lined up as usual.  We wouldn't have it any other way.

*****
Spirituality-
We're working really hard to make the offerings from the spirituality panel something special. We'll be offering old favorites like the meditation panel and Therianthropy Through the Ages.  This year's focus is on Egyptian deities and animal symbols, focusing on the lesser known creatures.  Everyone is familiar with Anubis and Bast, but have you met Maat or Sekhmet or Set?  Ever wonder why the crocodile and the hippo were both revered and feared?  We'll tell you all that and more.  This year's species focus panel is the unicorn, both the Eastern and western variants. We'll be discussing their similarities and differences as well as their mythological functionality within the civilizations from which they evolved.  This year's special feature panel is Animal Brides.  We will be referring to two texts which attendees may find interesting and may want for themselves: The Serpent and the Swan - Animal Brides in Folklore and Literature and In Search of the Swan Maiden - a Narrative on Gender and Folklore.

The scrapbook project has its own table this year and has been expanded to include any sort of memory important to attendees, whether it's someone who passed on, someone you don't see often, a  pet, a place, or an event. We would especially like to see people adding their favorite memories of past MFMs to the book so that we can make this a successful tradition.  We also need volunteers, preferably with scrapbook experience, to help us man the table and assist those who want to create their pages.

Finally:  we are having difficulty locating information regarding the lesser Egyptian deities and unicorns.  If you have information you can offer, book, or web site suggestions please contact either Garet or I (tygermoonfoxx at gmail.com)

*****
Greymuzzles - 
Once again the Greymuzzles will get together to figure out how we can use our experiences to help the Furry Community.

Last year we discussed putting together a "What's all this about?" poster to put on an easel in the lobby of the con hotel to inform the public what they are walking into.  We hope to have something ready for this year.

We will have our traditional breakfast/discussion and one or two more sessions during the weekend. 

I'd like to pose this question to the younger members of the community:
How can we help you?  

You are all welcome to attend our panels, and we are very interested in your input.

*****
Fursuit Games - 
We're ramping up the Fursuit Games for 2006! As of now, the tentative plan is for Friday night to be open Fursuit Volleyball, since it was so popular last year. We're still working on whether or not to have the main games on Saturday night or Sunday night. We're leaning towards Sunday. Still being ironed out are the events for the main games, but we are taking suggestions. (No Twister. Not gonna happen.) I still need a couple of referees, so if you know anyone, let me know ASAP. Also, I will be emceeing the games in suit this year, so if there are any complaints you can literally "talk to the paw"!

Could still use some input folks. What did everyone like last year? What did you hate? Lemme know!

Gilmore.

*****

Gaming -
MFM Gaming looks forward to bringing you the best of the Board, Card, and Roleplay gaming universe at MFM X.  For the first time ever, we're  going to bring you ten different panels on Roleplay Construction, Game Creation Ideas, Hobby Games, WarGames, and CCGs.  Whether you're a player, a designer, or somewhere in between, the Gaming Track at MFM will have enough to keep you interested and actively involved.   From the Tournaments, to the panels, to the collectible buttons.. MFM Gaming will step up to new heights to celebrate the tenth year of MFM.  See you there!

Jarrod

*****

Dance! Dance! Dance!
This year we will be in full gear for the 10th anniversary dance!  Karaoke with GrowlTiger of course Friday night which everyone loves.  This year, we will be ramping up the dance and karaoke with an addition of our own, a brand new projector!  We not only will be playing some of your favorite dance hits, but also will have music videos, live action on the "big screen" of people having fun on the dance floor, and some great visuals altogether. Send any requests for music and/or video of course to dance at mephitfurmeet.org.  ALL DANCES WILL BE FURSUIT FRIENDLY!!!  And also we're planning on having Shiro get a line-dance party setup for the fursuiters (although he's not a fursuiter himself).  Everyone should enjoy the party at night with GrowlTiger, Shiro, and Yoken keeping it going until the last fur falls...

*****
Lan Gaming - 
Hey hey hey! its the MFM LAN! come on by.. never know how late we'll be open! Lots of fun games and friendly furry fragging! With your hosts, Chestnut, Raczoon, Misha and Syrr!

*****

Subject: FL: Hello Friends,
Message-ID: <001201c68672$48fdbca0$1302a8c0@ELTEOR>

Greetings,

I am actively starting o work on my fur suit ... (in wich the finished form would be a snowy Owl) ...
and I'd like to have the tails and feet ready for Anthrofest (this August in Montreal) ...

I have a few idea of what I'd like as the pattern for the tail, and have a pair of shoe I can use for a fondation
for the feet as well ... What I am asking for are advices, patterns or thought on this ... particulary on what to use 
as padding/stuffing on the tail for it to move ; yet have substance... So far I was thinking of using a few old wire hanger but that 
is extremely rigid 

I am not good at drawing but I can send my preliminary sketches to anyone willing to help...

Thanks in advance :

Talmak

Works fine for me. Both when the original email arrived and just now. 
Might want to try it again.

You may have to wait till around halloween for somewhere like Jo-Ann's to
carry it (check the clearance rack maybe?). they tend to get plasic canvas
in all kinds of colors, but it does depend on the time of year (green/red
around xmas, orange/black at halloween, pastels at easter...)

Hey!
  Sorry I'm writing this so late, but I'd love to see what it looks like when it's done! 
     l\  /l
   =^ , ^   
  For the feet, you should definitely try to make the toes a little longer to give the impression that they're real toes instead of a covered shoe. (Maybe even not use shoes, but instead cover thick socks with fur/whatever you're using so that your foot looks thinner and it's easier to create the illusion of owl talons.
   
  Hope that helps!

Well, if the site is furry/fursuit related you might want to ask
timduru. He offers it free and fairly unlimited if the content is not
totally of topic. He, for example, hosts my site (www.sonix.dk) which
is fairly (but not completely) fursuit related.

You could always just host your our site. 

In order to do this, you'll need a computer that can run 24/7. Other then
that, all you really have to do is sign up at http://www.dyndns.com , and
select a web site name (Subdomian only :/ ). From there, you can get Apache
( http://www.apache.org/ ), which is the server program.

Setting it up can be a bit of a pain, but once it's done, you'll have total
control.

Efurry. It's a free-based furry web site domain host. 

http://www.efurry.com/

You can also inquire how to get your own domain name
at very low yearly rates. That's where I have my own
name domain hosted. It's great. Tell 'em SonicBlu sent
you. They'll treat you very well.

  I have a website, a really lame one, but the point is that my website sponser (freewebs) doesn't allow me to upload more than 100 pictures, put passwords in, etc. Are there any places where there aren't limits? Or at least free sponsers?

Efurry. It's a free-based furry web site domain host. 

http://www.efurry.com/

You can also inquire how to get your own domain name
at very low yearly rates. That's where I have my own
name domain hosted. It's great. Tell 'em SonicBlu sent
you. They'll treat you very well.

Hi friends,

For those attending AC this year, I'm in the process of getting approval for

convention center and take pictures with the apparatus.

This activity is tentatively being scheduled for Friday, June 16 from 7pm 
unitl 8pm, weather permitting, so if you're interested, pencil us in.

Currently the visit is awaiting approval by the city fire department's fire 
chief.

More info will be forth comming.

And are there any opportunities for guerilla fursuiting, too, at Pittsburgh, while we're at it? Or is heavy duty security around the area because it's a huge convention center?

You can try Furbid at http://www.furbid.ws or look on
eBay, it's a good start for a cheap fursuit.  But
most, if not all of them, are preused so don't expect
too much high quality.

Hi there!  I made my first suit for $100 spent over the course of 2
years, and no sewing skill to start with.  And I hand-stitched the
entire suit.  So it can be done!  Of course, having Fabric Depot in
town with their 40% off sales helps.

so you have 2 options, do yourself or buy a cheap
fursuit(sometimes might be used)

i did my first from normal midpile and low quality
fur, was hot and lacks many skills on sewing, i had
spent about 70usd in materials.

if you option to buy get a new one, give a look at
ebay, roam trough local flea market and look for
garage or yard sales.

  Well, the combination of GratisDNS.dk and EFurry might well be your friends. 
GratidDNS.dk is a free service that manages your domain names, and EFurry as 
you already heard provides you the webspace. GratisDNS really is as free as 
it can be - you still have to pay, but that is only the price of the domain 
name itself at the country or international registrar, plus the yearly 
upkeep. i use them for every domain name i control, and have never had a 
single problem with them :)

I've added a few new features, as well as fixed some bugs on
fursuiter.org. We're up to 146 users and 184 fursuits.

Two of the new features are quite cool.

http://www.fursuiter.org/map/

I've added a Google Maps API powered page, which is similar to frappr,
but is more integrated into the site.

http://www.fursuiter.org/collage.php

I've also added a collage of all the fursuit images, which is actually
an image map leading to the respective fursuit profiles. A very easy
way to visually scan just about everything on there ( unless no
picture is provided ).

There's quite a few features and bug fixes that I'll be working on
this summer. Please let me know what you like, what you don't like and
what you wish was available.

Perhaps I could send to somefur and reduce from

I can't seem to log into my account on  <http://www.fursuiter.org/>
www.fursuiter.org or on furry.wikia.com which is weird, cause I used to be
able to. The system is rejecting my password saying its "Invalid". I haven't
changed it, and I am accepting cookies. I requested the system to send me a
new password, but I haven't received a reply; I've checked my discards and
my system is set to receive the email. Also, when I try to create a new
account, my username is flagged as already in use. Help.

The fursuit mailing list (fursuit.org) has -nothing- to do with
fursuiter.org or furry.wikia.com. You can't expect your mailing list
password to work with a completely unrelated website.

Thanks Frysco, after I sent my message I realised that furry.wikia.com was
something entirely different and I created a new account there. Sorry for
the confusion on that one.

With regard to fursuiter.org, I thought I had an account there too, separate
from fursuit.org, which is why I was surprised I couldn't log in. I'll have
to investigate further tomorrow.

Hiya!
Got another question about fursuiter.org:
I registered and entered my profile, but how the heck do I enter a 
fursuit into the fursuit database?
I'm sure it's pretty simple but I still can't see how.

I would really like to offer a service equivalent to what I have for
the US zip codes. I have a fairly good idea of how to do it "cheaply"
( that is, without much effort ).

A quick and dirty way might be to allow the user to export a
place from google earth to a .kml file (select place, file->SaveAs,
choose *.kml, provide file name) and upload it as
an attachment.  Then just pull out the single line that
reads something like:

      <coordinates>-1.533312595607356,52.29717829165846,0</coordinates>

which are the degrees East, degrees North, and height (ignore).

Failing that, folks can just open the file with Notepad or whatever
and cut-n-paste these numbers remembering to reverse the two
numbers: enter the degrees north first, then the degrees east.

Saint Louis Pride Weekend!



Just a little over a week until the Saint Louis Pride Festival and Pride 
Parade June 23-25, 2006! We are once again planning a weekend of fun and 
frivolity for everyone. This event is open to everyone and most things are 
relatively kid friendly. You don't have to be Gay to join us. This is open 
to everyone! On the agenda for this year...



Friday June 23 - We will head out for a bite of dinner for those that arrive 
earlier in the day. Then we will have an evening of fun and friendship as 
everyone arrives at Furry Coffee at Mokabe's Coffee House!



Saturday June 24 - Everyone gets to sleep in a bit and then we will stop 
someplace for a bite of breakfast and then off to the Festival for the 
afternoon. After the festival you have some time on your own for the zoo, 
parks, and museums, or whatever.



At 6pm we will all meet up for the Pride Potluck at the Big Blue House..

Rules are as follows:

Bring a side dish to share (salad, casserole, etc) this should be enough for 
4-5 people

Lemonade will be provided, bring your fav beverage if you want something 
different

We will provide hot dogs, brats, smoked sausage on the grill and chips, 
cups, plates, plasticware and napkins will be provided. Alcohol is ok to 
bring, please just keep yourself under control!



Sunday June 25 - Parade Day!!! - It's an early start this morning. We will 
be getting up, grabbing a bite at Hardee's for breakfast and then heading 
over to the staging area for the parade (we have to get there early to avoid 
road closure and avoid parking issues)  The parade kicks off at 11am and 
will go till about 1pm. This is June, so plan on it being HOT! Make sure and 
bring yourself water bottles and such. We will have a large jug of water at 
the staging site and bottles of water at the Festival (end of the parade)



This year's theme is Pride Without Prejudice.  Both the Bad Dog Saloon and 
Cheap Trx are going with these themes. The Cheap TRX entry is going to have 
a western feel to it (Think Brokeback Mountain) and the Bad Dog Saloon will 
be a canine/lupine/vulpine themed entry. Everyone is encouraged to wear 
fursuits, ears, tails or whatever you are so inclined.



After the parade we will be heading to Chris's for a bite of lunch and to 
cool down and relax before everyone heads out.



I need R.S.V.P.'s for the weekend as soon as possible so we can make the 
appropriate plans. We have VERY limited crash space, but I do have rooms 
available at the just remodeled Red Roof Inn that is right by the Big Blue 
House for $73 a night. If you are planning on marching or Fursuiting in the 
parade please let me know what you will be attired in so I can match you up 
with the respective group (we are going to be next to each other in the 
parade hopefully) Also if you are coming to the Potluck on Saturday night, 
please let me know what you are bringing to share so we don't end up with 5 
things all the same!



Please let me know as soon as you can if you are attending to 
tygrcwby at hotmail.com  !!

Now that AC is in the bag... I would like you all to start thinking about 
the performance you might have planned for the Mephit FurMeet's 
Masqurade.   I have the distinct honor of being kinda in charge of the Masq 
this year.  (Yeah me?).  As we don't have a lot of time at the rehersal, 
try to have your idea's all hammered out and workable.

   I decided that this being the Tenth year of MFM, anyone that can work 
either Tin or Aluminum (which is the traditional gift for a 10th 
anniversary) into their act and make it work will get a special award.  The 
act's don't have to have that in there, but it would just be something fun 
to try to work on.

   Our excellent sound guy Protius is on deck to keep the sound up and 
running.  We would ask that it be standard cd format type of music or sound 
or whatever.  Anything else, please ask away off list (don't want to flood 
the list with silly little things, unless it's the performance list where 
things should be discussed..)

Scritches to everyfur!

I'm currently searching for any possible conpics from this year's AC, 
but to no avail. If anyfur out there knows of an archive or has a direct 
link or two I would be greatly appreciative. This was the last year my 
first suit I've ever made will ever be used, and I would love to have 
some last pictures/video of him. ^^

Thanks in advance, and hope everyone at AC this year had a good time 
like myself - no drama allowed! ^^

I found my inspiration for making my first fursuit and if that goes well  for 
making other fursuits. Anyone in the group familiar with the jogauni of  
Second Life?

I was a Gray Wolf suiter, in a long full-body black coat, most of the 
time wearing a fox puppet on my right paw. The first day of suiting I 
wasn't donning the lil' guy, but just my regular set of paws. Very 
"triangly" ears, a pair of sunglasses on the head as well. (Only way I 
could see anything! My vision is incredibly weak for a wolf. ^^

Thanks!

Hehehehe, thats hilarious, well, its about time we had some good
press.  But yeah, learn to pronounce it correctly.

Is it just me, or was the news anchor a little uncomfortable about it
when he started the report? Heheheh.

Thanks for the link. =^_^=

I think both of these news videos showed furries in a good light--nothing derogatory at all. A mispronunciation and a little bit of cluelessness isn't going to hurt anybody.

The only gripe I really have is that gas-mask fellow getting all the press. I fail to see where that has any relevance whatsoever to the fandom. Similarly, when I was asked at FurFright why one of us furry fans was walking around dressed as a storm trooper, I explained, "Oh, he's just a geek." :-O

As one of the people interviewed by WTAE I felt that there was an honest 
curiosity about us and desire to know more.  While I certainly don't want to 
be a spokesperson for the fandom the training I got in the Navy about 
dealing with the media did help me to steer the interview away from certain 
topics and wording.  I agree with Skippyfox that we came away from the 
interviews and newspaper report at this AC in a very good light.  Maybe 
we've finally turned the corner and are moving away from the 'bad press' 
syndrome.

I think both of these news videos showed furries in a good light--nothing 
derogatory at all. A mispronunciation and a little bit of cluelessness isn't 
going to hurt anybody.

The only gripe I really have is that gas-mask fellow getting all the press. 
I fail to see where that has any relevance whatsoever to the fandom. 
Similarly, when I was asked at FurFright why one of us furry fans was 
walking around dressed as a storm trooper, I explained, "Oh, he's just a 
geek." :-O

I started making a webpage about one of my fursuits and I went a little overboard. The thing sort of blew up into a fursuit retrospective.

http://www.weaponofcreation.com/files/ies/maurice.htm

The pictures aren't mine but I asked for permission to use them over a year ago when I intended to make this webpage. In my notes I made a memo to inform Boogi and "R. Hudson" (Robert Hudson I guess?) when the page was done.

The pages are still in Beta version, there are still some people I havn't credited for photos. If you want credit tell me by which name you'd like it. There's also a few pictures of Maurice along side some other fursuiters. If you want your character mentioned tell me about it.

Additionally if, for some reason you don't want your likeness or fursuit appearing in a picture tell me so I can edit it.

Reality television is terrible because it combines television and reality, both of which are pretty foul on their own.

Message-ID: <2ff545310606211350p18e5b3fdi4b86c54e3d2e258d@mail.gmail.com>

So, looking toward my next set of projects it would be very helpful to
head-shaped armature to work from.  The question is, go with a life-cast of
my own head or buy a generic FX head armature?  I don't know how much it
would cost to make the life cast but the generic head armature is about
$60.  Working off of a representation of my own knoggin would be nice but
not totally necessary.

So...What does it cost to have a life casting done?

And who in the Bay Area can I con in to helping me if I decide to go that
route?

Thanks,
Sean

I would also like to have a cast of my own head for making head pieces.  So
far it I found something called "Rigid Wrap" Its like a bandage with plaster
on it.  Other than that, I heard that its not too hard to just plaster your
own head, although I dont know what I would fill the mold up with to get my
head.  So if any one else has some good ideas I would like to know as well.

I would *NOT* suggest doing a full-head lifecast on your own. There's too 
many things that can go wrong. I'd suggest two people to do this on you. A 
full-face you can, but it's preferable to have a friend nearby to make 
sure nothing goes wrong.

Rigid wrap does nicely, but it's got a drying time that's longer than 
medical bandages. I'd suggest using extra fast or fast set.

I would strongly suggest checking the fursuit Wiki on lifecasting. If you 
want to go the cheap way, get a styrofoam head, measure your own head, and 
then use foam and duct tape to get the right proportions.

Howdy there!
    There are several people in the Bay Area who've done multiple head casts 
before and could probably be persuaded to help.  Materials would probably 
run you around $30 or so, though it's been a while since I've done one and I 
could be wrong, shocking as that may sound.

I would *NOT* suggest doing a full-head lifecast on your own. There's too
many things that can go wrong. I'd suggest two people to do this on you. A
full-face you can, but it's preferable to have a friend nearby to make
sure nothing goes wrong.

Rigid wrap does nicely, but it's got a drying time that's longer than
medical bandages. I'd suggest using extra fast or fast set.

I would strongly suggest checking the fursuit Wiki on lifecasting. If you
want to go the cheap way, get a styrofoam head, measure your own head, and
then use foam and duct tape to get the right proportions.

heh... Another reason why I suggested two people doing a full head cast is 
that since I have a hearing loss, I'd prefer a hearing person with me. 
That way, if something goes wrong and I don't hear it, the other person 
will and deal with it.

Another thing is that if the model knows sign language, I can understand 
what they're saying. So far, I've had one person sign while under the 
alginate. Creating hand signals if you don't know sign works well. Either 
way, you get feedback.

I think you were on camera that day. I messed up the deployment and had to get dressed behind an ambulance at the parade setup area. Thankfully you carried the duffel bag with my civvies to the end of the parade route.

Reality television is terrible because it combines television and reality, both of which are pretty foul on their own.

I'm gonna go against the flow and say head armiture.

Most heads are the same size, few people have odd eye/nose placements.  I'd only recommend getting your head cast if you had a freakishly large or small head.
Also, people making life casts are left to deal with a full plaster head, rather than the lovely hard foam ones that you can buy.  Much easier to use, lightweight.  Wonderful.

Plus, if doing a cast, you'll need to have a semi-professional.  Most don't go right, it's always little things - mixing the plaster wrong, heat of the room, lack of vaseline on eyebrows.  I've know FX guys getting their heads caught in the plaster.  Most people make low detail wonky moulds with air bubbles.

There's a few places to choose a good head armiture.

 And who in the Bay Area can I con in to helping me if I decide to go that route?

Well I'm back from Anthrocon, playing catch up in many ways, and had a fun 
time.  I didn't get to do much suiting in part due to staff commitments and 
some other issues that came up.  I did however have a mile stone event in my 
fursuiting in that I received delivery on my realistic lion head from Lionel 
of Lion of the Sun.  The link below will bring you to some (but not all) 
photos of the head that we took outside the hotel.
http://community.webshots.com/album/551594860xEibFg
In the process of taking these we gave a good fright to at least one person 
(maybe more) who thought they saw a big bad putty cat in the bushes.  Lionel 
handled one extremely well, getting them calmed down then added that the 
lion 'was his pet'.
*grin*

I will be commissioning at least one body suit, hopefully two (one realistic 
one more anthro) to use the head with within the next few weeks.  I can't 
wait to have a suit to use with this head.  Heck I've already had offers to 
lay around so people can have their picture taken with the lion.  That is in 
fact one of the things I'm hoping to use the realistic suit for, photo ops 
for charities.

A big thanks to Lionel for such a fine piece of workmanship and for taking 
the photos to share.

I often try and come up with ways to try and express things that really have 
no words. But I will make an effort here.

These are more than masks to me, I dont think I will ever be a profitable as 
some other fursuit companies
out there for the reasons of why I make them. Yes, I make some money , But 
for the most part people come to me
for my art because they see somthing in it that reflects a dream.

perhaps it has to do with the long periods before I discovred my capacity 
for art a year and a half ago, That the yearning
to see the face and form in the mirror haunted me, and for as long as I can 
remember wanting but never having that .. One.. real moment

My creations, every last one represents somones dream. Oh I may be reading 
more into it for the person or not. but it does not
stop me from weighing in the fact that , for some .. Like me,  Like Kamau. 
when the mask and suit go on and you see for the very first time
a face,  A face you have known in your dreams staring back in the mirror. 
There is a joy that rolls through you.. for some they roar or cry , or let
out the longest rested sigh you ever heard.

These are peoples dreams I am making real in some small way.

In the end I dont know where this will all lead me, I am swept up in the 
whirlwind of things I must do
things I wish I had more time to do. My life, if you knew all the twists and 
turns .. and now I am here .

If there is one thing I can say to everyone reading this page is simply 
this.

A year and a half ago I had gone through over 20 years of want and desire 
and dream, And in that whole time I had the
capacity to grant myself and others some of the greatest happiness I have 
ever known.

Even if you dont think you can do it ... DO IT, or at least try without an 
ounce of fear in you hearts, let go
of the doubts and shame and all the silly things keeping you from creating 
.. and Just do it

You JUST might shock the livin SHAT outta yourself.

Lionel

hey thanks for the kind words of inspiration, I'm making my first fursuit 
now and hit a wall, I was about to put the whole project on the back burner. 
after reading that I fell a boost of excitement and energy!

Subject: FL: Anthrocon 2006 Masquerade Followup
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.2.20060622214806.015dd6b8@incoming.verizon.net>

Hi all and welcome to this year's edition of the Anthrocon 2006 Masquerade 
Followup!

This year was yet another flawless, widely praised show, demonstrating that 
Anthrocon is the place to be for costume performance.

I'd like to thank everyone who participated for making this event perfectly 
as easy for me as it was for them.  Everyone was on their marks and 
attentive, resulting in a show that ran like clockwork.  I'd like to also 
thank John "KuddlePup" Cole for lending us his expert skills as MC once 
again and for helping me coordinate the rehearsal and presentation.

I also want to thank Simba_Lion, Cheetah, and both of their A/V staff and 
crews that worked tirelessly to present the performances with the light, 
sound, spots, cameras, and other tech that let the show be seen, heard, and 
recorded.  These guys supported not only the Masquerade, but every other 
event in that Ballroom.  If you see any of them, give them the appreciation 
they deserve because they're probably one the most hardworking crews for 
the whole weekend.

Finally, I want to thank all my Masquerade staff and volunteers, without 
whom there would be no event at all.  Their help is what keeps this event 
running on an annual basis and I hope they'll be just as eager to be with 
us again next year.  In no particular order, big thanks to Jesse "Tango" 
Stringer, Jason "creature" Murdock, Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Derek "ZenWolph" 
Sailor, Lincoln "JBadger" Kliman, and Steven "Tora" Sears.

Here is the list of the performances in the order they were 
presented.  They may be slightly inaccurate due to last-minute casting 
changes.  Titles were either provided or are a best description.

1. Bursty, SafetyFox, Summer Vixen, Dex, Takala, ZigZag, MortonFox, 
FreakyLynx - "Welcome"
2. Terry Mouse, Joshua Jackalope, Prismo - "How to Flame"
3. Fluff n' Such Productions (Non-Sanity Cat) - "Major Tom"
4. Shrag, ZigZag - "Dear Diary"
5. Wallywolf, Bursty, Swiftfox, Kwisa, Talyn, Norby, MortonFox - "The Lion 
Tries to Sleep Tonight"
6. HKUriah - "Daffy's Rhapsody"
7. Lillyfox, SonicBlu, and Friends - "Welcome to McDonalds"
8. Big Bad Bear, Delmir - "Gotta Catch 'em All"
9. Magnus Diridian - "What I Do, What I Do"
10. Eurofurence Phantom of the Pawpet Show - "The Wardrobe"
11. Johnny Vulpine, Valaroo Dragon, and Friends - "Furries Beat the Devil"
12. Sym - "Sym's Eulogy"
13. Fluff n' Such Productions (Non-Sanity Cat) - "I'm With You"
14. Cedar - "Fly Me to the Moon"

Thanks again very much and see you again in 2007!

- Rigel

Scritches to everyfur!

I'm currently searching for any possible conpics from this year's AC, 
but to no avail. If anyfur out there knows of an archive or has a direct 
link or two I would be greatly appreciative. This was the last year my 
first suit I've ever made will ever be used, and I would love to have 
some last pictures/video of him. ^^

Thanks in advance, and hope everyone at AC this year had a good time 
like myself - no drama allowed! ^^

The artist's name is Jay Van Buren and he does portraits in both charcoal and oils.  His private studio is in Long Island City, Queens NYC, easy to reach by subway.
 
You can contact him by email at  jay at early-adopter.com
 
The portrait  Jay did of me took several sessions of approximately 2-3 hours each.  
Foxwell will be his next subject.  :)
 
Jay did attend AC last weekend to learn about furry artwork and culture from a painter's standpoint and was very much impressed.

Absolutely correct!  Sorry all, I've been into the Digimon series too 
much; I forget most people don't know the characters.  The character is 
yellow with a white belly, purple sleeves over the arms and a pointed 
muzzle.  The character has purple yin yang emblems on the thighs.

I haven't seen any photos of the suit up online yet; I'll post mine soon.

Subject: FL: Thermo-Insulating Fursuit Feet
Message-ID: <062720062122.4393.44A1A17F0004813B0000112922058891169801000E9B020E9C@comcast.net>

I've poked around in the FAQ and on the fursuit LJ and haven't found any reference to this, so I'm going to post it to see if anyone can give me any pointers.

All of my fursuit feet have simple rubber soles.  Three of the pairs I built on top of aqua sox, while the other two pairs I completely custom built with soles made out of 1/2" rubber matting.  With one of those custom pairs, I actually have two layers of that matting, making for a 1" of sole.

My problem is that both kinds of feet do not insulate my own feet from the heat of walking on blacktop in summertime temperatures.  At my last event, where I was wearing the custom built pair with two layers of the rubber matting, my feet were still getting very hot, and when I had to take breaks, it was not because I was getting too hot throughout my bodysuit and head areas, but because my feet were roasting.

I'm just curious to know if anyone has found a good material to line the inside of fursuit feet with that will help to thermoinsulate them from the heat of the surfaces you are walking on?  I always wear regular athletic socks, and my aqua-sox based feet all have insoles that came with the aqua-soxs.  I'm wondering about those gel-type insoles, but I don't want to spend the money on a pair without knowing for sure if they'll actually insullate against heat from the ground.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I've got at least three more summertime character appearances, so I'd like to find something right away that will solve this problem.

Thanks and Cheers,
Santa Fox

I meant to wait until I had more photos up but seeing time is marching on 
I'll post this now.  At Anthrocon Lionel (http://www.lionofthesun.com/) 
delivered my new lion fursuit head and we took some photos of it.  I've 
posted 16 of them up on my Webshots page 
(http://community.webshots.com/album/551594860xEibFg).  I hope to put more 
of the out doors shots and a few taken in the lobby of the hotel later as I 
get time.

I don' know about right away, but I built mine around slippers, with
probably about a half inch of craft foam sheets (8.5x11 inches) and
faux leather on the outside for the soles.

Here is a link to the pics of building my feet:

Hope that helps a little.

    Mine have always had a layer of foam under my feet...  They're big 
feet, so I have about an inch of foam between the ground and my foot.  
Makes for squishy bouncy feet, and I've walked around in some pretty hot 
environments without my feet ever being unusually hot.
    Not sure if you can rework your feet and glue some extra foam on the 
bottom, but it's a thought.  Even a thinner layer of foam, if you can 
find something durable enough, would help.  And add a layer of leather 
on the very bottom, to keep the foam from being torn apart.

To Santa Fox:
   
  Hello Santa!
   
  Am I gonna get lots of presents this year?... hmm sorry hehe.
   
  Anyhow, I used to wear mocassins for Ren Faires all weekend, un-padded for a while, but when I added gel-soles my feet were much more confortable and cooler after a full day of walking around. - My feet also were not sore after a busy weekend :)
   
  As for fursuiting, I'm currently wearing surf-shoe footwear covered in fur also, I haven't noticed that my feet get got yet, but they do get sore after walking around on cement or pavement - I was planning to add gel-soles to them after Anthrocon to solve that problem. I might have to get a larger pair of surf-shoes to fit gels inside of them comfortably.

I'm pretty sure FireHopper is fine as he lives nowhere near any of the major rivers (Delaware flooded around Bucks county, Susquehanna flooded up by Wilkes-Barre where 200,000 residents were evacuated, and Manayunk in Philadelphia took a drink from the Schuylkill).

Nice design.  It reminds me a bit of how my own hind paws for my wolf fursuit were oritinally made:

the one big difference though, is that it was AB foam rubber in a mold instead.

We hope everyone had a fantastic time at AC, and it sounds like it was a
great success. For now, your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to keep
aware of developments regarding FC2007. We've got a lot of news this time so
this email will NOT self-destruct in 30 seconds.

1.  FC 2007 Dealer's Room and Furry Market Place News

In August, we will be selecting at random people from the Dealer's Room
waiting list to be offered 10 half-tables for FC 2007.  In order to be
included in the selection, you should have your waiting list form sent in by
August 1st, 2006. Please allow sufficient time for the USPS to deliver it to
us by that date. There will be a second round of random drawing from the
waiting list in November for any additional table space that is available at
that time.

The first round of 10 Furry Marketplace spaces will be sold on a first come,
first served basis also starting on August 1st, 2006. Those interested will
need to send in an application form by mail postmarked no earlier than
August 1st - any earlier postmarks will be placed at the back of the list.
The first round will end September 15th. No e-mail applications will be
accepted.  We've listened to your comments, and the price for a Furry
Marketplace space for FC 2007 will now include one full membership. 

Application forms for space in the Dealer's Room and Furry Marketplace, as
well as rules governing each area, can be found at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/dealers.php>. Please e-mail
dealers at furtherconfusion.org if you have any questions.


2.  FC 2008 Dealer's Room Sign-Up Changes

As promised, we've looked at the way space is allocated in the Dealer's
Room, and after listening to all the comments, we've decided to try a new
method for FC2008 that should allow everyone a chance at that rare commodity
- a table in the dealer's room!  For those interested in the changes for
2008, details can be found on the Dealers page at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/dealers.php>.


3.  Pre-Registration News

Pre-registration for FC 2007 is available on-line at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/registration.php>. Rates are $40 for
the entire convention, and you may either register on-line, or print out a
registration form and mail it to us with payment. The web page also gives
details of some of the goodies you'll get if you register at the Sponsor
($100+) or Patron ($200+) level. Patrons and Sponsors may also claim back
part of their payment on their taxes as a charitable donation. Please e-mail
registration at furtherconfusion.org if you have any questions.


4.  Hotel News

ON-LINE ROOM RESERVATIONS: You can make your reservations thru the link on
our website and the sooner you do so, the more likely you will be able to
get your specific request, whether it's a smoking room or two Double Beds.

SUITES ARE SOLD OUT!!  Yes, already! Of course we only have 8 suites
available but still we wanted to let folks know. 

FURSUIT AND PARTY FLOOR ROOMS ARE GOING FAST!! We only have two floors to
work with for the Fursuit Floors and one for the Party Room Floor, so if you
plan to make a fursuit room request or party floor request, make your
reservations now and get your request in to hotel at furtherconfusion.org

1ST FLOOR ROOMS: Due to ADA requirements, we cannot take any more requests
for 1st floor rooms unless it's for medical reasons.


5.  Themed Website Launch

Hopefully by the time you get this the themed website will be launched. Many
thanks to Foofers, Jonas, Frysco and the rest of the marketing team for
helping us get it up and rolling. We hope to add some link banners and
additional items in the near future.


6.  Furry Night Live

Get ready your spy gear, decoder rings and undercover disguises, Agents!
Furry Night Live is back again on Sunday night as the number one place to
see furry variety acts performed live. Break out the shoe phone and deploy
those dashing agents, femmes fatales, and thuggish hench-bears. Your
mission, should you choose to accept it: Assemble your secret forces to put
together an act or skit fitting the spy theme "Fur Your Eyes Only." Are you
a Rogue Agent with no act or skit?  Not an Impossible Mission! Our crack
team of operatives will have scripts, acts, and skits for you to participate
in. For more information contact Furry Night Live Lead Yippee Coyote at
fnl at futherconfusion.org. To subscribe to the official Furry Night Live
discussion E-mail list go to
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/fnl_signup.php>


7.  Further Confusion Summer Picnic and Campout

Picnic: Saturday, August 12, 2006, 11 am 'til 5 pm
Camping: Friday, August 11th & Saturday, August 12th

It's time again for the annual Further Confusion summer picnic!

We're back at Lake Chabot (at the nearby Anthony Chabot campsites) for
camping and picnicking. We will be holding the picnic on Saturday, August
12th from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m. There will also be camping available on
Friday and Saturday nights.

For those who wish to attend the campout, we are asking $5 per person to
offset the costs of the campsites, and you must RSVP for the camping part of
the trip (send email to camping at furtherconfusion.org). 

The picnic is free and open to all - no RSVP Required!

As usual, we'll provide the food and drinks. More food is always welcome,
though, as are folks to help out in setting up, cleaning, and otherwise
making the picnic happen. Our next staff meeting is at noon on July 15th.
If you are interested in the planning for the picnic, just show up to the
Doubletree Hotel at noon, and we will find some way to put you to work!

This year, we will be at the Turtle picnic site at Lake Chabot, and will
meet there at 11 a.m. There will be a tent there for people to change into
costumes. There will also be some items from past Further Confusions on sale
(T-shirts, DVDs, etc) and we're also aiming to have the FC2006 DVD available
for sale there, so stay tuned. This will be your last chance to get the $35
(camp)fire-sale price for a Further Confusion 2007 membership.

For directions to the picnic and campground, check out the page on our
website: <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/camping_picnic.php>.


8.  FCTV Seeking Material

Its that time of year again. Have some nifty furry video or show you'd like
to see on FCTV? Well now's the time to start the submittal process! Right
now anything with a PG or lower rating is on the table, so submit away! Any
length, any format. To submit, just send an e-mail to
fctv at furtherconfusion.org with information on your submission and we'll take
it from there! Also feel free to e-mail if there's something you yourself
didn't make, but would like to see on FCTV! We'll reach out to content
creators ourselves if we have to! Deadlines for major content submission is
November 31st (I need time to prepare it all), so if you've got that great
video idea, get filming! 

For any and all other questions, remember info at furtherconfusion.org is the
place to go, along with our website at www.furtherconfusion.org.


9.  Events Staff Needed

We still have many staff positions available in our Events section. If
you've had prior experience organizing and running conventions, or even if
you just want to lend a friendly paw, WE NEED YOU!

For details, e-mail events at furtherconfusion.org, or come to one of our
staff meetings.

Still-open positions include track leads for: Business & Marketing,
Puppetry, Science, Species, Spirituality, and Writing.


10. Next Staff Meeting

In July, there'll be two Further Confusion public staff meetings - one on
July 15th, and another on July 29th. Both will be at noon at
the San Jose Doubletree.

Parking is free - just tell the parking attendant that you're with Further
Confusion when you arrive, and then get a sticker for your parking slip in
the meeting.


Open Channel D!

Both suits are indeed by Kiowolf.

His website is at http://kio.furry-tales.com/ and he has an LJ account 
of the same name if you're on LJ.

Ah the forth of July.  Great day of celebrations and parades which means I 
get a chance to fursuit with my fire department.  So early this morning I 
got out my tiger fursuit, E. M. Tiger, and went down to the station.  We 
left for the town the parade was in at about 9:30 AM and arrived somewhat 
before 10:00 AM.  The step off time for the parade was not until 11 so I 
stood in headless fursuit for more than an hour chatting with folks and 
watching as the rest of the parade got formed up.

This was the town's 200th anniversary as well as the 4th of July so there 
were many more trucks, floats and marchers than usual.  This included a 
number of horse groups (including one beautiful four draft horse team with 
wagon from Shale Hill farm).  Knowing all to well how a fursuit can distress 
a horse, even without a head, I stayed well clear of them.  A few riders 
however couldn't resist coming by which fortunately didn't create any 
problems.  All this time I'm watching the clouds gather and hoping it won't 
rain.

Finally we step off and due to several children of members of our department 
riding the original pumper (1939 chevy) I don't have my usual spot to stand. 
This was okay by me because I turned over the candy tossing duties to the 
kids and road the back step of the truck where I could hop off and interact 
with the crowd.  I did this much to my pleasure and the crowds.  About 5 
minutes into the parade however it started to mist but nothing more.  While 
not the greatest for my suit (a Marylen Siberian Tiger) past experience told 
me the head would be okay if I dried it once done.  In fact I hammed it up a 
bit by begging for an umbrella at one point and when refused sadly returned 
to the truck.

The next time I stepped off the truck however something didn't feel right. 
As I returned after my toying with the crowd I saw why.  There was a perfect 
paw mark in the middle of a pile of horse apples.  Can you say SH ! T?  Well 
I sure did.  With no low line vision in the suit I didn't know how bad I'd 
gotten it so simply scraped the bottom of my foot on the truck rear step. 
After the parade I took off the head and was greeted with the odor of my 
misstep.  Thankfully it was not into the fur but mostly on the bottom.  I 
got what I could off and when back at the station cleaned it more 
completely.

Ah, but wait there's more.
With the suit being damp and one scented paw I didn't put it back into the 
container but spread it out on the seat of my van to drive home.  After 
putting the van in the garage I gathered up the suit, head and container and 
headed for the house.  While it had stopped misting before I got back it 
chose this moment to go into full, instant on RAIN.  I made a dash for the 
house, juggling fursuit bits and box all the way and arrived with a mostly 
wet fursuit and fursuiter.  Some days just don't end the way you'd like.

But I did enjoy the outing, the suit and head are now sitting in front of 
fans drying and I'm getting ready to do a bit of World of Warcraft with a 
friend (if the server will unload some other folk).

Majorly... Some parades I've seen have people walking behind the horses 
with rolling trashcans and large shovels dressed as clowns or something, 
sometimes hamming it up while they do the cleanup job.

Just wondering about this, but has anyone out there had a spotter to guide 
the mascot around the smelly piles? What did they do to prevent the mascot 
from stepping in the piles?

Hi All

Having sone many country fairs - animal left-overs seem to be very common..

Of course - Marc's feet are soled with industrial carpet  squares so its
easy to wash off.. Also adds that natural aroma to the realism :>

Take Care

Thankfully, after the clean up and a night's airing out, there's no smell.

No such luck here however.  Too small by parade standard I guess.

Spotter would certainly help.  I've found when doing my fire dept. gigs I 
usually don't have a spotter because either they need everyone in uniform to 
march or they are busy running the activity.  Not the best way to do things 
I know but I've had almost no trouble with tail pullers or the like at such 
events.

Hi Is this guy looking to make a harness for a mascot or puppet. We use 
harness systems all the time. I am one of the owners of Up front Mascots 
www.mascotsupfront.com  We don't use straps persay we add a close cell vest 
to the bottom of the head and just have straps to tighten the vest. This 
gives the performer complete control with comfort. If you need any more help 
let me know.
Thanks Karen
Up Front Mascots

It's basically a matter of doing research and legwork.  I don't know of any simple way to find all the charitable groups in a particular area, so I just keep my eyes and ears open and take notes when I see or hear of an event that looks interesting.  Sometimes people I talk with will suggest groups to me, and sometimes I might just come across a flyer or an ad for a group.

Once you've found a group, research them.  See if they have a website, and use that to find out what sorts of activities they do throughout the year.  Many groups have one or two yearly fundraisers, and those are great events to target.  Usually there will be specific contact info for those events, and you can use that to get in touch and offer your services.  If the group has their own mascot, and that work appeals to you, then you'd probably want to contact the public relations division of that group.

This is just the tip of the iceburg, but it's a great way to get started.  A really easy way to find charitable groups in your area is to go to any large festival type event that has lots of vendor boothes.  Usually there will be quite a few local charitable and non-profit groups in those booths, and you can talk with their representatives and find out about what each group does.  The reps might not be able to tell you right away if your character services would be useful, but they can most likely give you contact information for the right person(s) within the organization who could help you.  

Of course, while you're there, you should also talk with the people running that festival event, because they might be interested in having you as a general purpose entertainer at the event.  While they probably wouldn't let you perform that very day (possible, but not likely), they might invite you to entertain (or apply to entertain) at the festival the next time it occurs.

Just my two bits.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

Message-ID: <44AF653D.2030803@pawpet.org>


Here it comes!  Florida's furry arts and entertainment convention is
back for another spin, and this time, we're bringing the fun to the
First Coast!  This is the first of many regular updates on Megaplex
2007, which will be held on March 2-4, 2007, at the Wyndham Jacksonville
Riverwalk, Jacksonville, Florida.  We'll have more information on the
hotel in a moment, but first...

LET'S MEET OUR GUEST OF HONOUR!

Megaplex 2007 is happy to announce that Mike Kazaleh will be joining us
as Guest of Honour this year!  Mike is a professional animator and
comics artist; old-school furry fans will remember his comics work on
"The Adventures of Captain Jack" (Fantagraphics), and "Mean Green Bondo
Machine" and "The Suit" (MU Press).  He has also drawn "Ren and Stimpy"
for Marvel, "Cow and Chicken" for DC Comics, and "The Mighty Mutanimals"
for Archie Comics, and is currently working on "Futurama" for Bongo
Comics and "Camp Lazlo" for DC.

Animation-wise, his credits include "The New Adventures of Mighty
Mouse", "Tiny Toon Adventures", and "The Simpsons"; more recently, he
has worked on "Krypto the Superdog", "Johnny Test", and "Hi Hi Puffy Ami
Yumi".  He was also a storyboard artist for the upcoming movie, "The Ant
Bully".

Please join us in welcoming Mike to Megaplex 2007!

WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR #1?

It's time to play!  This year, we're working up a Game Show theme that
is sure to entertain.  If you have an idea for a panel or event that
fits into our theme for 2007, drop us a line at
megaplex-feedback at pawpet.org .  We want your feedback on exactly what
you want to see at the convention, and we want to get with folks who
would like to run said panels and events.  Megaplex is ultimately the
members' convention, so help make it the best it can be!

We're always on the lookout for volunteers, as well.  Drop us a note if
you'd like to help out in March.

Now, about that hotel...

HOTEL RESERVATIONS OPEN!

This year, Megaplex 2007 will be held at the Wyndham Jacksonville
Riverwalk, in downtown Jacksonville, Florida.  The hotel is just off of
I-95, on the Southbank of the St. John's River.  Full directions will be
located on our web site (http://www.ppmp.info) shortly.  (As a note, if
you look for the hotel using a mapping service like MapQuest, you may
find it under its old name, the Radisson Riverwalk; it re-flagged
earlier this year.)

The Wyndham is a short distance from the Museum of Science and History
(MOSH), Friendship Park, and River City Brewing Company, which can
easily be reached via the Riverwalk.  The hotel is also a stop for the
S.S. Marine Taxi service (http://www.jaxwatertaxi.com), which is a
convenient way to get to the shops and restaurants at the Jacksonville
Landing (http://www.jacksonvillelanding.com).  The San Marco shopping
district is close by, and Five Points and Riverside are just over the
Fuller Warren Bridge (I-95 to Park Street).  Jacksonville International
Airport (JAX) is 20 minutes away.

Reservations at the hotel can be made ON-LINE this year!  This method
requires a credit card to use. Here's how:

1) Surf to http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/JAXHT/main.wnt .

2) Click on the "Get Rates or Make A Reservation For This Hotel" link,
just under the hotel's address.

3) On the next page...
    a. Leave "Select A Rate Plan" (Section 1) as "Best Available &
Wyndham.com WEBRATES".
    b. Enter your arrival and departure dates (Section 2).  Remember,
Megaplex is March 2-4, 2007.
    c. Specify # of Rooms, and folks staying in them (Section 3).
    d. Skip past Section 4, unless you're a Wyndham ByRequest member and
want the credit.
    e. In Section 5, type the following in the "Group Code" blank :
0301886pa
    f. Click "Check Availability"

4) The next page shows the rooms available.  You should see "Pawpet Live
Experiences" as the Rate Plan, and $99/night as the rate for regular
rooms.  Click on the rate for the room of your choice to continue.

5) On the next page, double-check the selections in Sections 1-4, then
fill in Sections 5-8 and click "Confirm Reservation".

If you prefer to reserve by phone, call (904) 396-5100.  Be sure to

Reserve early!  Reservations close on January 30, 2007, so get your
rooms as soon as possible!

If you have any questions on the hotel, feel free to contact Randy Fox
at mp-facility at pawpet.org.

WHERE'S THE WEBSITE?

Our website is currently being redesigned by the lovely and talented
Jess (Lynxcat) Kiela, who's also taking care of business in her new,
somewhat cooler domicile Up North.  We've seen preliminary art for the
site design, and it looks great!

Our web address (http://www.ppmp.info/) may briefly point to our
official LiveJournal community
(http://community.livejournal.com/megaplex/) until we're ready to
unleash the site onto the Internet.  Once the new site is up, we'll be
able to take registrations on-line.

NEXT MEETING!

We'll be holding our next face-to-face meeting down in Orlando on
Saturday, July 15th, at 5:00pm EDT.  We'll be at the Bear Rock Cafe at
Millenia Plaza.  (From downtown Orlando, take I-4 west to Exit 79 (John
Young Parkway), and turn left.  About a mile down, turn right onto
Millenia Blvd, then turn right on Millenia Plaza Way.  The restaurant
will be on your left.)

In future months, we'll be setting up meetings in the Jacksonville area,
as well.  Stay tuned for further updates!

If you're not in the area, come chat with us!  We use the same IRC
server as the Funday Pawpet Show does - irc.pawpet.org 6667.  I'll be in
the #megaplex channel on most Sunday nights, during the Funday Pawpet
Show (7pm-11pm EDT), and we'll have weekday evening meetings open to the
public as well (watch this space).  If you want to learn more about
Megaplex, find out how you can help out, or just meet and greet, please
join us!

STAY TUNED!

Keep an eye on http://www.ppmp.info/ and
http://community.livejournal.com/megaplex/ for the latest news and
information, and please do not hesitate to drop us a line at
megaplex-feedback at pawpet.org (or to me directly at mp-ceo at pawpet.org) if
you have suggestions or questions regarding the convention.

Also, please join our dedicated mailing list for Megaplex!  Information
on joining can be found at
http://lists.pawpet.org/mailman/listinfo/megaplex-list .

Hope to see you at Megaplex 2007!

Many Cities have a mascot registration for companies who have mascot costumes. If you can get that you can contact the companies and see if they are looking for performers. I know lots of charity groups have mascots and sometimes finding people to wear them is a problem. To bad you are not in Edmonton I know a lot of people who could use you.

How would one get in touch with "mascot ragistration" for their city? A cursory search of Google and the Blue pages didn't really help.

Hi you would need to call each city and ask if they provide that service. 
Here in Edmonton, Alberta Canada they have a communications department it is 
out of. Sorry can't help you much more than that. Darn we are looking for 
someone to wear our mascot for events. Anyone from Edmonton and wants to get 
some exposure. We could use you...

Subject: FL: Second Casting Call for RAGGS Kids Club!
Message-ID: <8C8732D65E1A611-1924-2290@MBLK-M22.sysops.aol.com>

I am looking for two people, one character and one escort/stagehand, 
for the RAGGS Kids Club (www.raggs.com) show at the Big Fresno Fair 
(www.fresnofair.com) for Wednesday-Thursday, October 4th-5th.  The pay 
is $100 a day (for 3 shows, 25 minutes each) and a hotel room is 
included, double occupancy.  You will need to provide your own 
transportation though.  The height for the character is very flexible 
(5'7" to 6'2").  The character also has to study the video and script 
and learn cues and simple dance steps.  "Roadie" will help the 
characters suit up, set up/tear down stage props, assist with props 
during the show, and sell RAGGS merchandise after the show.  If you are 
interested in either position, please e-mail me off the lists at 
minnieme4rl at aol.com.  If anyone can forward this to the So Cal Paws and 
Claws List, I'd really appreciate it!

Minnie
(Razzles and RAGGS West Coast Tour Manager)

Time is getting closer and I would like you all to start thinking about the 
performance you might have planned for the Mephit FurMeet's Masqurade.   I 
have the distinct honor of being kinda in charge of the Masq this 
year.  (Yeah me?).  As we don't have a lot of time at the rehersal, try to 
have your idea's all hammered out and workable.

   I decided that this being the Tenth year of MFM, anyone that can work 
either Tin or Aluminum (which is the traditional gift for a 10th 
anniversary) into their act and make it work will get a special award.  The 
act's don't have to have that in there, but it would just be something fun 
to try to work on.

   Our excellent sound guy Protius is on deck to keep the sound up and 
running.  We would ask that it be standard cd format type of music or sound 
or whatever.  Anything else, please ask away off list (don't want to flood 
the list with silly little things, unless it's the performance list where 
things should be discussed..)

For all the fursuiters out there who think they have what it takes to be called an Iron Fursuiter, I invite you to come out to Mephit Fur Meet (MFM) in Memphis, Tennessee this Labor Day weekend to compete in the first annual MFM Iron Fursuiter competition on Saturday night in the Garden Atrium.

Only one can be crowned the ultimate Iron Fursuiter - will it be you?  The only way to find out is to enter the competition, where you will put your skills on the line as you compete in challenges that will test your strength, stamina, speed, and inner balance.  Do you have what it takes to beat out the competition and claim the title and the prize?  

For more details, please see this post: 

  http://community.livejournal.com/mfm/44832.html

To sign up, send me an email with your furry name and fursuit character name (if different from your furry name) that you will compete as.

Even if you don't want to complete, I'd love to have as many suiters as possible come out in suit to watch the games and cheer on the competitors.  

Cheers,
Santa Fox

I could also use some help here as well, I'm remaking my head in a
compleatly different style.  Pointers on muzzle construction would
greatly help me as well.  Thanks all.

Out of curiosity, I just measured my new Santa Fox head that I finished up a few weeks ago, and it's seven inches from tip of nose to the bottom of the eyes, and eight-and-a-half inches from the bottom of the eyes to the top center of the head (right behind the ears).  Oddly enough, the ears are also seven inches tall, from base to tip.  

So, there's some general numbers to start with - of course, you'll want to tweak that to fit your ideas of your character - there's no perfect formula that's going to work right for everyone.  

The best place to look for general muzzle construction tips is, of course, in the FAQ, and then if you have more specific questions that aren't answered by the FAQ, post them here on the list.

Hi There

When I made Marcwolf I tried an idea that seemed work work well.

I got a long strip of alumilium and started from the base of by neck (at the
back) and folded it over the top of my head until I reached the bridge of my
now. Then I bent it outwards.

cool! thanks! my next question is how do you get the curves out of the fur? 
is it glued onto the foam or did you sew curved peices together to form a 
round part?

Well..  I just snipped and added pices until I got the general look ok.

Afterwards I then put some plastic mesh - about 1cm square (brought from a
gardening store as a plant trainer) and then wired it to the oewn areas.
That way I could sew the fur on where I could not glue.

The calico pattening trick of wrapping somethings in calico and marking it
helped me work out the general shape when the fur was on. And afterwards
gave me the pattern to cut the fur with.

Take Care

Marcwolf

Hi Ray
It depends of how wide you made the head. We have made fox ears on average 4 - 6 inches. But sometimes they need to be longer to look animated, or if the fox is to be a baby fox you want them to be larger so the head will look more youthful. Do you have a drawing when you are sculpting it from a drawing it helps... If not keep standing back and seeing if that is the size you want. Make it from paper first pin it to the head and look before you sculpt from foam.

  hello! i'm starting work on my fursuits muzzle and ears, i'm haveing alot of trouble deciding how long they should be, so far what i've seen is that the nose to eye is about the same distance as the eye to the top of the head which would make it about 3 inches long and no idea how long the ears should be ^^ by the way i'm trying to make a fox

  thanks!

Hi Foxwolf
I make the muzzles from a closed cell foam similar to what life jackets are 
made from. first do a drawing... then use paper to see if the look you are 
getting is what you like. We pattern from the skins of the foam as it is 
flexable and can be sewen into shape. When you know that is the shape you 
need glue it together. and attach to head. you can do it the old way and use 
foam it is just a lot more work and won't hold up as long.

you put darts in the fur and keep it going in the same direction yes sew it 
first make a sock like piece that goes over the ear and glue it as you are 
putting it on. We do that all the time. We actually make a whole face with 
mouth linner and eyes in one piece and start at front of the face and work 
back glueing as we go. It works great but requires a lot experiance. I hope 
that helps a bit.

ray use spray glue so you can pick where you want the glue. us it on 
corners, and inside ears but not everywhere. Spray glue gives you control.

Heyla all,

I have been roped into a project that has me hunting for fur. LONG fur. It
need not be on neato, stretchy, spandex, can go shopping, and walk the
dog, and take my credit card to Paris and not come back for a week- kind
of fur.

I can't seem to find long fur (3" or better) on a fixed backing, because
that's really all I need. I am thinking I am going to need between 3 and 5
yards.

I am looking for something in muted browns, yak colours would be nice.
varigated is fine, unvarigated is kewl too. Heck, lots of scraps would
even be awesome.

I am not afraid to spend *some* money, but the completely awesome site
that sells for 20-30$ per square foot... yipe. If only I could shrink the
booger!

So any help, bag-o-scraps for sale, or comments would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance. any replies will be greatly appreciated... possibly
even worshiped. ;D

Hi Montary Mills has a retail side. We get long fur there a lot. It is 
basicly cut of pieces but it may be a start...

Hello Karen!

  Thank you for the reply.

  I had forgotten that I did look at them. I was afraid the shag pile
looked kind of flat in colour. Has anyone else worked with it? I was
thinking I would have to patchwork it *shudders*, or possibly airbrush
it. Is there a longer pile available anywhere else?

  Forgive me, but I am afraid I do not follow "It is basicly cut of pieces
but it may be a start..." What does this mean?

  Thank you all in advance.

It really is a strange yak creature, that is supposed to be Furry and
animal, so it needs to shift back and forth. Cryptids are rather-- well,
weird. :D

The furry is made, I am not even worried about that. I have this hoop
skirt idea for him to be an animal is giving me fits. Something like a tea
cozy, he just bends over and slips it over his costume and is good to go
and carry at least one rider. :) The saddle is nearly finished. I've had
such fun researching the saddle I am ready to cry over the rest. So near
and yet so far.

montary has a two tone brown long fur.. It is light tan outside with a dark 
almost back base. It is great because it has demention and will flow when he 
walks... Not sure if they have it in yard pieces. I buy it by the roll... I 
am in Canada so not easy for me to ship you some.. Ask them about it...

I don't think there are any really worthwhile graphics programs that
have an easy learning curve as such. I personally use Adobe photoshop,
but Paint Shop Pro is also a good tool... and there is, of course,
also The GIMP, which is also fairly good and also free.... I'm not
sure this is what you want, but those will get you a long way at least
:)

You might also try Art Rage - http://www.artrage.com/artrage.html
The basic version is free (and usable).

The GIMP (gimp.org) isn't the easiest, especially if you know nothing
about Photoshop, but it's free and extremely powerful, and there are
lots of tutorials and helpful people online.

You can either use Adobe Photoshop, Painter, or Jasc Paint Pro. I recommend Adobe, just because it has the most variety of things to use and such.

Hi everyone thanks for the info on the graphics program. I picked Xara Xtreame It has a short learning curve, has movies for teaching and does everything I need. It is also 1/4 of the price of other  graphics programs..

For those wanting the power of Photoshop without chopping off a hand to 
pay for it, Try "GimpShop"... Its 'The Gimp', but all of its menus and 
options have been compiled into a way that Photoshop people are used to 
seeing them!!

http://plasticbugs.com/?page_id)4

Whats great is that its available for Mac, Win and Linux!

Any store that carries bicycling supplies should have balaclavas.
Here, I would try Fred Meyer (kind of like a SuperTarget), Target,
G.I. Joe's, R.E.I., Big 5 Sporting Goods, and any number of bicycle
specialty shops.

The best place I've found for wig stand (or mannequin heads) is E-Bay.  I
found one that is just slightly smaller than my own head for about $15,
shipping inclusive.  You may or may not be so lucky.

Once you get it, you'll still need to mount it.  Hit up rummage sales or
the like to find an old coat tree or something that you can mount the head
on.  You'll want to be able to easily move around the head during
construction (I found this out the hard way when building my first head
using the mesh-and-foam method).

Good Luck.

Hoods can be found year round at any motorcycle accessory shop.  Bikers wear
them in the winter to keep their heads warm and in the summer to keep the
sweat from soaking their helmets.  They are cheap and meant to be replaced
once they get washed too many times.

									 -----------------------------------

1. Guest of Honor announcement

Further Confusion 2007 is pleased to announce our first Guest of Honor for
next January. Please welcome Baron Engel to our convention. Baron's been
drawing since the age of eighteen ... months, that is. His first
anthropomorphic art resulted from an art school class assignment requiring
deliberate distortions of the human figure. His instructor, impressed by
the comparatively vivid and engaging results, encouraged ("do you want a
good grade in this class?") an initially reluctant Baron to continue
developing this style, and by the end of the semester, he was hooked. At
college, majoring in commercial illustration, he encountered science
fiction literature and art, and set his sights on making his living in
that genre -- putting him on a collision course with anthropomorphic
fandom. 

In 1989, Baron was still unaware anyone else was interested in that sort
of thing. But while looking for reference material, he was advised to
seek out the Society for Creative Anachronism. At one of the meetings, he
came to the attention of last year's Further Confusion Artist GoH, Eric
Elliott, who (at the top of his lungs) singled Baron out as a furry
artist! The rest, as they say, is history, and Baron's been involved in
the fandom ever since. 

Along with his anthropomorphic art, Baron has worked in the commercial
market, comics, and the entertainment industries as a concept designer. He
and Christina "Smudge" Hanson founded Backbreaker Studios LLC in 1997 and
since then have conducted numerous demonstrations and panels for art
groups and conventions. His pieces have been exhibited at local museums --
winning several awards -- and thirty to forty conventions a year in the US
and abroad. 

Baron's hobbies include cooking, history, paleontology, astronomy,
wildlife, reading, aviation, lucid dreaming, shooting, anime and comics,
and mechanical thingies. Examples of his work can be seen on the Web at
<http://backbreaker.com/>


2. FCTV Submissions

Its that time of year again. Have some nifty furry video or show you'd
like to see on FCTV? Well now's the time to start the submittal process!
Right now anything with a PG or lower rating is on the table, so submit
away! Any length, any format. To submit, just send an e-mail to
fctv at furtherconfusion.org with information on your submission and we'll
take it from there! Also feel free to e-mail if there's something you
yourself didn't make, but would like to see on FCTV! We'll reach out to
content creators ourselves if we have to! Deadlines for major content
submission is November 31st (we need time to prepare it all), so if you've
got that great video idea, get filming! 


3. FC Summer Picnic and Campout Information

Picnic: Saturday, August 12, 2006, 11 am 'til 5 pm
Camping: Friday, August 11th & Saturday, August 12th

It's time again for the annual Further Confusion summer picnic!

We're back at Lake Chabot (at the nearby Anthony Chabot campsites) for
camping and picnicking. We will be holding the picnic on Saturday, August
12th from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m. There will also be camping available on
Friday and Saturday nights.

For those who wish to attend the campout, we are asking $5 per person to
offset the costs of the campsites, and you must RSVP for the camping part
of the trip (send email to camping at furtherconfusion.org). 

The picnic is free and open to all - no RSVP Required!

As usual, we'll provide the food and drinks. More food is always welcome,
though, as are folks to help out in setting up, cleaning, and otherwise
making the picnic happen. 

This year, we will be at the Turtle picnic site at Lake Chabot, and will
meet there at 11 a.m. There will be a tent there for people to change into
costumes. There will also be some items from past Further Confusions on
sale (T-shirts, past DVDs, etc). This will be your last chance to get the
$35 (camp)fire-sale price for a Further Confusion 2007 membership.

For directions to the picnic and campground, including the Campout FAQ,
check out the page on our website:
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/camping_picnic.php>.


4. Staffing Needs: A/V Tech, Events

A/V Tech Staff Needs:

Tech is being run differently this year. You can be on tech staff and
still have a convention! We are accepting sign-ups for shifts of work.  You
can sign up to work just specific events, like FNL, or the masquerade, or
sign up to specific time slots.  This means anyone can sign up, even
people from other countries!  The way it works is you sign up as a
"Dedicated Tech Gofur" and then we sign you up for your shifts on tech
staff. You could choose from lots of different jobs from running cameras
for FCTV, spotlight operator, sound board, stage ninja, even an usher if
you want. No experience is necessary, and we'll train you on the job if
you sign up as a second, or "shadow" for a shift.  We need to fill the
following shifts ASAP:

1. Furry Night Live, all positions
2. Masquerade, All positions
3. Setup, all positions (Day before FC starts) 
4. Strike (Day after FC ends)

Shifts are filled on a first come first served basis except where shift
directors have prerogative. 

Shift directors are the leads for each of our 6 tech departments.  Many of
these positions have been filled, but we could still use some
seconds/backups, as well. The requirement for a director is that you must
be local to the bay area, and be able to attend most of the regular FC
staff meetings.  (In subsequent years, this restriction may be lifted for
people with demonstrated experience)

Events staff still needed:

We still need some track directors. You do NOT need to be local to FC to
take these positions, though if you are not, you should be able to
communicate effectively with FC Writing Track:

Species/Science Track
Business Track
Spirituality Track
Creator's lounge 


5. Dealers Room Announcement

In August, we will be selecting at random people from the Dealer's Room
waiting list to be offered 10 half-tables for FC 2007. In order to be
included in the selection, you should have your waiting list form sent in
by August 1st, 2006. Please allow sufficient time for the USPS to deliver
it to us by that date. There will be a second round of random drawing from
the waiting list in November for any additional table space that is
available at that time.

The first round of 10 Furry Marketplace spaces will be sold on a first
come, first served basis also starting on August 1st, 2006. Those
interested will need to send in an application form by mail postmarked no
earlier than August 1st - any earlier postmarks will be placed at the back
of the list.

The first round will end September 15th. No e-mail applications will be
accepted. We've listened to your comments, and the price for a Furry
Marketplace space for FC 2007 will now include one full membership. 

Application forms for space in the Dealer's Room and Furry Marketplace, as
well as rules governing each area, can be found at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/dealers.php>. Please e-mail
dealers at furtherconfusion.org if you have any questions.


6. Art Show Reservations going on sale

Art Show Panel Requests will be going on sale in early August. You can
watch <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/artshow.php> for
announcements or send in a request for an information packet to
artshow at furtherconfusion.org


7. Fur Your Eyes only Dance Input Requested

My name's Amadeus and I am the Social Track Lead for Further Confusion
2007. Over the past few weeks, I have been reading the many compliments
and complaints about past dances at Further Confusion in the past couple
years, and I have taken all your ideas into consideration and will be
acting on a number of them. This next year, for FC07, I am pleased to
announce that we will be having a wide variety of music genres available
to congoers. Everything from rock and roll, metal, punk, 80's, 90's,
techno, and everything else in between that we can squeeze into an
extended weekend. Also changing this next year is the way the official
Fursuit Dance itself operates. Many of you have written in claiming the
Fursuit Dance doesn't have enough danceable music for those of you who

[Please pardon the x-posting]

Hello Friends!

You may have seen our advertisements in Anthrocon?s or Morphicon?s con book 
and now I?m here to remind you the Western Pennsylvania Furry Weekend, 
http://www.wpafw.org, is being held Columbus Day weekend, October 6-8, 2006, 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This year?s ?Featured Artist? is the renowned 
Shawntae Howard, writer and illustrator for the popular ?Extinctioners? 
comic book. http://www.extinctioners.com

The event staff and I are continuing to host this event, now in its seventh 
year, and inviting furs from New York, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, 
West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey as well as our friends 
north of the border in Canada, and of course, Pennsylvania. Building on the 
successes of our past events we?ve adjusted our registration structure and 
secured a 400 square foot meeting room at the Comfort Inn Pittsburgh North 
for our Friday Furry Social and for our Saturday Night Prowl and Growl. By 
hosting these events at the hotel we hope to provide a more centralized 
weekend experience and provide more appeal to securing a hotel room for our 
guests.

Event Pre-Registration is now OPEN!! Registration for the Western PA Furry 
Weekend covers the Friday Furry Social, Fur-b-que and Prowl and Growl on 
Saturday.

Pre-registration begins now and runs until Friday September 23, 2006.
? Basic level Pre-registration is $15. (Gets you into the Friday Furry 
Social, Fur-b-que and Prowl and Growl on Saturday.)
? Supporter level Pre-registration is $20. (All of the above plus front line 
privilege for food at the Fur-b-que, five Charity Raffle tickets, our 
esteemed gratitude, and other swag to be determined.)

We?ve had a number of folks register already and several of those signed up 
at the Supporter level.  As for the rest of you?what are you waiting for?  
Don?t miss out!  October is only two months away! :)

Lodging arrangements have been made with the Comfort Inn Pittsburgh North, 
just off PA Rt. 28 and PA Turnpike Exit 48, in Harmarville, PA. The Western 
PA Furry Weekend has secured a block of 20 rooms for both Friday and 
Saturday nights at a flat rate of $69.99 + tax.

The staff and I would also like to announce that once again our Furry 
Weekend Charity is "Animal Friends," Pittsburgh's only no-kill animal 
shelter.  Last year we raised nearly $400 towards this worthy cause. If you 
can help by making a donation of original goods or services please visit the 
event website and send an e-mail to Akirashima, our Charity Raffle 
coordinator, at charity at wpafw.org.

This short message by no means conveys all the information available on this 
year?s event. I encourage you to visit the Western PA Furry Weekend website 
at http://www.wpafw.org for pre-registration, programming and activities, as 
well as lodging just to name a few. I also invite you to sign up for the 
Furry Weekend Forums where you can get the latest information on the event, 
pose questions and suggestions, and hook up with your friends for room and 
ride shares.

So mark your calendars and register now to join us in the beautiful autumn 
clad foothills of the Allegheny Valley and see friends old and new.

The Western Pennsylvania Furry Weekend, October 6th, 7th & 8th, 2006!!

Hi all. I'm looking into becoming an animal costumed character for
hire. Like for party's and what not. I'm in the proses of looking for
an agent now. The point of this post is what advice can anyone give me
that's not in the FAQ. In the FAQ there is advice for mascots but not
for costumed characters for hire. The agent that I talked to expects
me to act as a clown and not as a person in an animal costume. Like
face panting blowing up animal shaped balloons and what not. With out
being able to explain exactly what I can do they are just being nice
and friendly but not really helpful. From the conversation that we
had. I need to come up with an act and games to play to be
entertaining. I would love any advice on this and anything else that
can be relevant.  The only experience that I really have is doing
stuff at cons. Like posing for photos and stuff up on stage.

Yes I've found out that's always the expectation when you try to get hired  
through a party business...they all want the same thing from entertainers:  
clowns, face painters and balloon animals.  Some even have the clueless  audacity 
to ask if you can make balloon animals while in your animal  costume!  Nobody 
really seems to care about getting a real mascot to do a  "little" birthday 
party, as long as it's a looklalike costume of a recognizable  character.

First off, there are two lj communities you may want
to repost this question to:  fursuit_gigs &
behindtheseams.  Would also try posting it on some of
the ton of fursuiting lj communities out there.  They
may have more info on mascoting but could also find
someone with experience in what you need.

Most of my experience has been in non-paid volunteer
work, mascoting at parades and charity events.  I
could relay my experiences in doing that but it may
not be that different from the FAQ.

Gotta ask, will they be providing a costume for you or
do you have a costume in mind for this job?  Can you
bring help, people that aren't in costume or minimal
costume?  Could come up with some skits or something. 
Should also consider being able to grab members of the
audience.
Do they have a set of guidelines or rules you'd need
to follow?

Im gonna have to speak up and disagree with you there.  Ive been working for a party company for the last few years, doing birthday parties almost every weekend.  It all comes down to what the child wants and how far the parents are willing to go to give them what they want.  Next comes money.  If you are talking about a real mascot, they are paid performers, who generally get paid a minimum amount for their work.  Unless the child is really interested in that sport team, the parents usually aren't willing to shell out that money.  They usually want to use that money to get someone else there for a longer period of time.  Why have the mascot of your local team there for $200 for a half hour when you can have a generic clown or lookalike character for the same price but for a full hour.  Alot of it has to do with disposable income and what people are willing to pay.  And some other parts of it have to do with what you get for your money.  I see every weekend people want that professionalism but are unwilling to pay what it costs to get it.  Thats why there are lots of opportunities for regular people to be costumed characters.

For myself, we have a package deal.  Songs, games, interraction for a set price.  They know up front what they are getting and there are no surprises.  Instead of talking to an agent, try calling around to some of the local entertainment companies, or look in the phone book for some.  Around me there are no less than a full dozen.  I kept calling til I found one that made sense in their expectations.  

Your thoughts?

Based on a couple of points in your post, I'm going to make the possibly incorrect assumption here that you are looking to get paid to entertain with your own personal animal costumes.  If not, then a lot of what follows won't apply, but maybe it will be useful for others.

I've been marketing my own costume animal characters for virtually the entire time I've been performing in costume (I'd never performed any kind of mascot or costume character before I built my first costume).  I run my own business now, and one thing I've never done is to use an agent - I've always just marketed myself in the community with pretty decent results.  Lots of cold calling and advertising where I can do it for free, though now I do a little bit of low-cost advertising, which has gotten a few more people to come to me with job offers.  

I've been skeptical about going through any kind of agency for jobs (other than mascot jobs via TMO), but I must also admit that for all of my marketing efforts, I've yet to actually do a birthday party - lots of other kinds of events, but not a single birthday party!  Still, if you're talking with an agent who doesn't understand the nature of costume character entertainment, you probably want to find a different agent or try going it on your own.

Regardless of whether or not you use an agent, you definitely need to sit down and develop a marketing package around whichever character(s) you want to hire out.  Figure out what makes the character special, then try to write up a blurb about the character that describes him/her and excites the reader about the idea of having that character appear at an event.  You can use this blurb when talking with either prospective agents or prospective clients.

Having a shtick helps, so if you have a good routine for your character, be sure to promote it in your marketing.  If you don't have a shtick, think about coming up with a short (roughly five minutes) routine that you can learn and perform with your character.  This routine can help to define the nature of your character, and the more you've defined a character's personality, the better you can market that character.

Be sure to do a good photo shoot with your character (get someone who knows how to take good pictures), and use those pictures to create flyers, business cards, and a website.  On your website, post video clips as well, so that prospective customers can see what your characters are like in action.

If you have multiple characters that you want to market, by all means provide information on all of them - you never know when someone may want something specific, so the more options you can provide, the better.  That said, if you are focusing on children's entertainment, you'll want to primarily promote yourself with your most child-friendly character(s) - whichever ones are the softest, sweetest, most lovable of what you have to offer, as you need something of that nature to draw parents to your services.

Don't forget that you need to get your business license and liability insurance, and you'll have some extra paperwork at tax time.  Keep track of your business expenses and your mileage so that you can claim all possible tax deductions, helping you to keep more of your hard earned money.  You'll also want to create a standard performance contract, so that you can create a firm agreement between yourself and your clients that doesn't leave anything important open to personal interpretation.  Keep in mind that you have to do all of these legal tasks, even if you get all of your jobs via an agent.

If this sounds like too much, then you may want to start out with just volunteering at community events and other small-potatoes stuff.  The important thing is to treat these volunteer appearances as professional jobs.  You should conduct yourself as a professional, should still have liability insurance, and you may even want to do contracts for these appearances.  The key is that you won't have near the same level of issues to deal with as a volunteer as you do when you are officially in business.  Best of all, you'll gain experience and some notice in your community, which will help a lot should you decide to go into business later on.  This is what I did:  my first year-and-a-half of performances were all on a volunteer basis.  At that point, I felt ready to start my business venture, and while so far it's been challenging, it's also quite a rewarding experience.

If you have further questions, feel free to bounce them off me - all told, I've been marketing my characters for three years now (1&1/2 as a volunteer and 1&1/2 via my personal business), so I've been through quite a bit in that time.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

Okay. Then try this link:

http://www.worldclownassociation.com/

They are not specifically animal costume oriented but they seem to
offer resources for perfomers for hire for kids events. They also
offer several resonably priced packages for liability insurance. I've
got coverage from their agent for the work that I do. It's inexpensive
and clients like and sometimes require the fact that a perfomer is
covered for a given event.

Cheers,

Hey Peoples,

As Maya and 3d max are awsome for modeling, I am wanting some direction in 
finding a patternmaking programme, that will unwrap a stl 3d file, as CAD 
INventor doesnt do this.

Gerber 3d direct does, but is impossible to attain.

As this would be fantastic , as you only need to print out the pattern on a 
plotting machine for about $20A (Aussie currency).

Thanks,

Luke.

Anyone wondering about Wekless Waskles, it's coming. Three years later, all 
furs bought, just need patterns.

I'm getting there.

Also The eyes I said about ages ago. Use high impact styrene and shape with 
heat gun, beats acrylic.

Also for clear lenses, sus out "VIVAC" like petg, but forms awesome. Sorry 
about not posting images haven't had computer since chrissie, waiting till 
duo 2 arrives in OZ.

Forgive me if anyone was hanging out for images,

Also, Anyone on South OZ that is bout 5'2 and would like to bring my 
character to life down the track for $$$. I'm not getting it made for 
someone who isn't keen for camera work as this is a major project.

Time is getting closer and I would like you all to start thinking about the 
performance you might have planned for the Mephit FurMeet's Masquerade.   I 
have the distinct honor of being kinda in charge of the Masq this 
year.  (Yeah me?).  As we don't have a lot of time at the rehearsal, try to 
have your idea's all hammered out and workable.

   I decided that this being the Tenth year of MFM, anyone that can work 
either Tin or Aluminum (which is the traditional gift for a 10th 
anniversary) into their act and make it work will get a special award.  The 
act's don't have to have that in there, but it would just be something fun 
to try to work on.

   Our excellent sound guy Protius is on deck to keep the sound up and 
running.  We would ask that it be standard cd format type of music or sound 
or whatever.  Anything else, please ask away off list (don't want to flood 
the list with silly little things, unless it's the performance list where 
things should be discussed..)

Hello Friends and Fursuiters!

As the cooler temperatures and colors of Autumn approach it's time again to 
consider the prospect of getting a group of furs together to march in 
Conneaut Lake's Fall Pumpkin Fest Parade. The Pumpkin Fest theme for this 
year is "Pirates."

The parade takes place on Saturday, October 14th and steps off at 10AM. 
Conneaut Lake is in Northwestern Pennsylvania about a half hour south of 
Erie, PA, an hour and a half north of Pittsburgh, just off I-79.

Last year after the parade we had a brief picnic/tailgate party at Conneaut 
Lake Park and then suited up again and wandered the small "mom & pop" 
amusement park posing for pictures and interacting with the guests.

Right now I'm posting to get a feel for how many furs and fursuiters might 
be intested in this day long opportunity. Please respond to events (at) 
swiftsden.net if you're interested in participating. I need a preliminary 
head count when I contact the parade coordinator and our contact at the 
amusement park.

For more information, please inquire in your missive or visit the Fall 
Pumpkin Fest website at http://www.pumpkinfest.conneautlake.com/index.htm

Thank you for your interest.

 Just a quick and probably stupid question, is the Masquerade kind of like a variety show? With skits and such? Because when I hear the word "masquerade" I think big masked ball *phantom of the opera nerd*. Just thought I'd ask :3

  Time is getting closer and I would like you all to start thinking about the 
performance you might have planned for the Mephit FurMeet's Masquerade.   I 
have the distinct honor of being kinda in charge of the Masq this 
year.  (Yeah me?).  As we don't have a lot of time at the rehearsal, try to 
have your idea's all hammered out and workable.

   I decided that this being the Tenth year of MFM, anyone that can work 
either Tin or Aluminum (which is the traditional gift for a 10th 
anniversary) into their act and make it work will get a special award.  The 
act's don't have to have that in there, but it would just be something fun 
to try to work on.

   Our excellent sound guy Protius is on deck to keep the sound up and 
running.  We would ask that it be standard cd format type of music or sound 
or whatever.  Anything else, please ask away off list (don't want to flood 
the list with silly little things, unless it's the performance list where 
things should be discussed..)

Masquerade! Paper faces on parade!
Masquerade! Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade! Every face a different shade!
Masquerade! Look around - There's another mask behind you!
Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads . . .
Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade! Grinning yellows, spinning reds . . .
Masquerade! Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!

(The answer to your question is yes)

For those that are interested in some of Universal's characters.  I will be
making quick amateur video edited make-ups of each character with their
Theme music throughout both parks.  Maybe later on I can try and get
everyone to do skits at work for better themed videos.. but for now, just
what they do on their normal set location is what I film for practice, and
to let them see abit of what I can do.  Plus I'm still learning video
editing.

This one features all of Seuss Landing's characters EXCEPT Thing 1 & Thing
2.
It was filmed on August 10th by my coordinator, along with myself.  I'm
surprised at how it came out for a 1 hour edit (throw together).

The Grinch in the middle of the film is me, while the one at the end of the
video is someone else & more nicer, so I accompanied him with more light
hearted music.

ENJOY!!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfP767ovGOU

Probably having to do with the fact that the acts are ideally in
fursuit, and are thus wearing masks

Most are, but most acts without the use of a fursuit

I recently got to wear a Cat in the Hat costume for Barnes & Noble. It looks
amazingly similar to the one in the video, with the exception that it had a
wire upright tail and there were no whiskers on his cheeks (I thought I saw
some in the video). I was impressed with the detail on the costume itself,
each one of those "stripes" on his fur is black fur sewn to white. Our
costumes are normally made and maintained by Costume Specialists, but I'm
wondering if these two were made by the same company... Perhaps Costume
Specialists does work for Universal too. I have never worn a costume more...
complex to put on. A nylon strap around the waist to support the tail, and
another to hold the head on (the hat would've pulled the head off mine
without it), and a special headpiece that velcroed inside the head itself.
Goodness. While I am not typical costume build, being 5' 1" and a fuller
figured woman, the costume was a bit snug, but really no problem. Especially
thanks to the ice vest made by J.T. on this list, it helped flatten out my
more feminie build.

As for the video, the only rough spot I noticed was at the end of the
segment for the Green Eggs and Ham characters. Other than that some really
nice transitions even into the closing credits! I'd love to see more of
these. They'd really help me with my own performances.

Hey there,

> wrong with that?

Using Styrofoam is not a traditional method for head construction, 
however it has been done with success in the past.  I remember a 
particular Civet who was built with this method quite successfully back 
in 97.

You will find it hard to the touch, but then there are people who prefer 
fiberglass, and there are also those who use vacuform which is a rigid 
plastic understructure.  And even those who use wire frame.  I suppose 
its what you are comfortable with.  Experiment and find your favorite 
materials.

Styrofoam has a couple draw backs vs high density open cell foam 
however. It is much more messy when carving.  Fire retardant properties 
are less than of standard soft polys. And you will find it is does not 
breath at all.  So make sure you have ventilation.

Other than that, have fun with it!

There are a few places that sell foam in person, as Karen had suggested, 
check out your local upholsterers for the soft stuff.

There are a couple places you can check who may ship if you are not in 
the vicinity of a local outlet.

http://www.bobsfoam.com/  (our local vendor)

http://www.foamorder.com (not sure if they have Styrofoam)

A Google search will yield you several results from which I am sure you 
can find what your are looking for.

Good luck.

biggest problem with styrofoam is durability...it crushes and unlike foam, it wont reshape itself you'll have a dent in your head.  also it's not as forgiving to getting squashed as foam important if you plan to travel with it by air.

Check Home Depot or Loews for Styrofoam insulation sheets.

There are usually a couple of damaged ones in the bunch and you can ask for 
a discount on these as contractors usually don't want them..

They are only a couple of inches thick, but can be bonded with latex contact 
cement.

I used this method on the first mask I made and it worked well.

It just makes a poor quality mascot head.. I use LD60 foam the same stuff life jackets is made from. It is light, won't retain odors, is easy to work with and stands up to anything. I get it here in Canada from a company called Norsefoam in BC. not sure where you can get it in the USA. It is so easy to work with and you will love the final result.

 Just browsing through the WikiFAQ and thought I'd offer my two cents about dealing with long hair. I have mid-back length hair, and its quite a pain sometimes. Putting it in a ponytail makes a tight fitting head harder to put on. So what I like to do with it, is get one of those stretchy cloth book covers. Take one pocket and fit it over your head, and use the other pocket to tuck your hair into. You'll look silly, but it'll keep your hair off the back of your neck and also help the suit head slide on and off easier. Hope it proves useful to you all :)

Oh wow! That's a really good idea, thank you. I have very long hair
also (almost 3 ft now) and trying to put it in a bun or swimcap made
it very uncomfortable to wear the head.

[Please pardon the x-posting]

Hello Friends!

I?m here to remind you the Western Pennsylvania Furry Weekend, 
http://www.wpafw.org, is being held Columbus Day weekend, October 6-8, 2006, 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
But time is running out!  Event pre-registration will close in exactly one 
month and after that the cost to attend the event and reserve a room at the 
hotel will go up measurably.   So what are you still waiting for?

Building on the successes of our past events we?ve adjusted our registration 
structure and secured a 400 square foot meeting room at the Comfort Inn 
Pittsburgh North for our Friday Furry Social and for our Saturday Night 
Prowl and Growl. By hosting these events at the hotel we hope to provide a 
more centralized weekend experience and provide more appeal to securing a 
hotel room for our guests.

This year?s ?Featured Artist? is the renowned Shawntae Howard, writer and 
illustrator for the popular ?Extinctioners? comic book. 
http://www.extinctioners.com

Pre-registration runs until Friday, September 23, 2006.
? Basic level Pre-registration is $15. (Gets you into the Friday Furry 
Social, Fur-b-que and Prowl and Growl on Saturday.)
? Supporter level Pre-registration is $20. (All of the above plus front line 
privilege for food at the Fur-b-que, five Charity Raffle tickets, our 
esteemed gratitude, and other swag to be determined.)

Lodging arrangements have been made with the Comfort Inn Pittsburgh North, 
just off PA Rt. 28 and PA Turnpike Exit 48, in Harmarville, PA. The Western 
PA Furry Weekend has secured a block of 20 rooms for both Friday and 
Saturday nights at a flat rate of $69.99 + tax.

Our Furry Weekend Charity once again is "Animal Friends," Pittsburgh's only 
no-kill animal shelter. Last year we raised nearly $400 towards this worthy 
cause over the course of two events.  This year we?ll have to try to exceed 
that donation in only one event.  If you can help by making a donation of 
original goods or services please visit the event website and send an e-mail 
to Akirashima, our Charity Raffle coordinator, at charitywpafw.org.

This short message by no means conveys all the information available on this 
year?s event. I encourage you to visit the Western PA Furry Weekend website 
at http://www.wpafw.org for everything you need to know about 
pre-registration, programming and activities, as well as lodging. I also 
invite you to sign up for the Furry Weekend Forums where you can get the 
latest information on the event, pose questions and suggestions, and hook up 
with your friends for room and ride shares.

So mark your calendars and register now to join us in the beautiful autumn 
clad foothills of the Allegheny Valley and see friends old and new.

The Western Pennsylvania Furry Weekend, October 6th, 7th & 8th, 2006!!

Western PA Furry Event Staff.

  I just use the book covers because they're cheap and I know you can get them anywhere, unlike balaclavas, which I haven't seen locally. And J, nah, I don't have a pic. I could always try and take one though if you want :)

I suppose I should finally speak up here.  I also use a hood to cover up 
my hair in suit.  A good supply for these is a dance studio, where they 
sell ballet outfits and such.  They should have black and white hoods.

Since my hair tangles easily, I wrap up my ponytail as well.  I stitched 
up a long tube of fabric and simply thread my hair through it.  A couple 
of hair ties later, and I'm set.

**************************************

<< Guests of Honor for 2007 Announced >>

Morphicon is proud to announce our Guests of Honor for 2007.

Steve Plunkett has been involved with furry since 1993, and has attended 
over 30 furry and furry-related conventions. He has been a staff member with 
Morphicon as the director of our Variety Show for the past three years, and 
staff at Mephit Furmeet and Further Confusion. He is most well-known for 
advancing the art of puppetry within furry fandom. More recently he has 
started working with fursuit constriction.  Even though he's "one of our 
own", we felt this honor was overdue, and we're very pleased to name him as 
a GoH.

Summer Jackson is a popular furry artist who has appeared in numerous furry 
publications, including Gallery, Yarf, and Furrabian Nights.

Kitt Foxx is a furry artist and an accomplished costumer, currently living 
in California.  He was also the winner of our t-shirt contest last year!

We'll have more information on Summer and Kitt in an upcoming release.

**************************************

<< Morphicon 2006 Free Fall Picnic! >>

Once again, our annual picnic returns!  Come celebrate the beginning of our 
fourth convention year and stuff yourself with delicious food.

When:  Sept. 2 (Saturday), 10am at Sharon Woods.
Details:  Sirloin burgers, hot dogs, pork chops, sodas, and sides will be 
provided free courtesy Morphicon, but feel free to bring your favorite side 
dishes if you like.  The con will occupy a shelter, and provide the fire.

**************************************

<< NEW Morphicon Group and Emails >>

The Morphicon Group location has changed!  We're now located at:

http://groups.google.com/group/Morphicon/

Join to chat with other attendees and supporters, find ride and room-share, 
and hear about any changes to our upcoming events.

Also, the staff emails will be changing to gmail accounts.  The following 
emails are currently active for any questions you might have:

ConCom Chair (Max Goof):  morphicon.chair AT gmail.com
Operations (Pelzig):  morphicon.operations AT gmail.com
Publications (Kattywampus):  morphicon.publications AT gmail.com

**************************************

<< Registration and Dealers' Tables Open >>

The online registration system is now open:

(Trickster notes: it's also much easier to use this year!)

Dealers tables are also available.  Contact morphicon.dealers AT gmail.com

Steve Plunkett has been staff at (and was a founder of) Midwest Furfest, not 
Mephit Furmeet.  (I actually knew that--but I'm certain I'm not the only fur 
to have confused the two names at 3 am!)

Also, for those lists that weren't crossposted to, pictures are up from 
Morphicon 2006 and from Morphicon's annual march in the Columbus Pride 
Parade:

Message-ID: <44F3A4DC.000003.01756@CEROLOBO_TABLET>

This is rather strange. Today I received a message through Frappr Maps
stating that CBS is searching for a fursuit family with at least one kid

Message Received through Frappr

Dear Sir or Madam,

I'm a Casting Producer with ABC Television and we're looking for unique
families with unique interests and lifestyles to feature on our primetime
documentary-style programming. I'd love to feature a family who wears and
collects fur suits on "Wife Swap," ABC's family show that allows two very
different families the opportunity to experience a different lifestyle and
while also teaching another family about their own family philosophy. We'd
love to feature families who perhaps perform in the children's entertainment
field - or even families who wear fur suits to ConFurence-type events to
celebrate their love of animals. Whatever the reasoning behind it, we think
fur suits are interesting ? and we?re betting our viewers do too! Our show
is about showcasing different interests, past times, and sub cultures in
America. We're looking for a really outgoing fun fur suit wearing family who
could bring a lot of fun and whimsy into the lives of another family for a
week. 

Please don't be confused by the title - Wife Swap is a family show on ABC
primetime. The premise is simple: two moms from two very different families
get the opportunity to swap lives (but not bedrooms - everyone has their
own!) for a week to experience what it's like to live a different lifestyle
- and to see what they can teach each other about their own! In this case we
re looking to feature outgoing families with unique interests and hobbies -
and all the fun that goes along with it. 

All featured families will receive a $20,000 financial honorarium - and
$1000 goes to anyone who refers a family that makes it on the show! We are
looking for two parent families with children (between the ages of 5 and 18)
who are ready for adventure! I appreciate your help with reaching out to
these great families and look forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,

Heather Teta

I say don't take the offer I already heard that they want you on trading spaces just to make us look really bad. I say no for it... I doubt there is any way on earth that they could get me on the show just to make us look like dirt.

I just find it odd that certain lingo is being used what seems
intentionally.

It is just ignorance is all, I think.

 

I've seen the show and not once have they tried to make someone look bad.
Their goal, imho, is to demonstrate difference in people. No excessive
exploiting, or anything like a news article. It is just that people are
curious and they want to see something they don't normally see firsthand.

 

I say go with it, and rarely would I ever suggest that.

Dear Sir or Madam,

 

I'm a Casting Producer with ABC Television and we're looking for unique
families with unique interests and lifestyles to feature on our primetime
documentary-style programming. I'd love to feature a family who wears and
collects fur suits on "Wife Swap," ABC's family show that allows two very
different families the opportunity to experience a different lifestyle and
while also teaching another family about their own family philosophy. We'd
love to feature families who perhaps perform in the children's entertainment
field - or even families who wear fur suits to ConFurence-type events to
celebrate their love of animals. Whatever the reasoning behind it, we think
fur suits are interesting - and we're betting our viewers do too! Our show
is about showcasing different interests, past times, and sub cultures in
America. We're looking for a really outgoing fun fur suit wearing family who
could bring a lot of fun and whimsy into the lives of another family for a
week. 

 

Please don't be confused by the title - Wife Swap is a family show on ABC
primetime. The premise is simple: two moms from two very different families
get the opportunity to swap lives (but not bedrooms - everyone has their
own!) for a week to experience what it's like to live a different lifestyle
- and to see what they can teach each other about their own! In this case
we're looking to feature outgoing families with unique interests and hobbies
- and all the fun that goes along with it. 

 

All featured families will receive a $20,000 financial honorarium - and
$1000 goes to anyone who refers a family that makes it on the show! We are
looking for two parent families with children (between the ages of 5 and 18)
who are ready for adventure! I appreciate your help with reaching out to
these great families and look forward to hearing from you soon!

 

Best,

 

Heather Teta

You're not the only one who got that.  It's probably legit, but I don't

I think its a prank message sent by a fur. There is something common with
the furs that got the e-mail. Probably off a fur cons chat room or
something.

If it was true I would do it. I'm not afraid or shamed of being a fur. If I
would not be hassled by the cops I would fursuit down the street. I love
going places in ears tail and hooves.

I think the show is looking for a furry family (mom, dad and kids) so  
that narrows the scope of the request pretty far.  They've been  
sending the request out on as many furry mailing lists as possible so  
it doesn't appear to be targeted to any group within the fandom  
(other than 'families').  As far as the legitimacy of the request I'd  
guess they were actually legit and its not a fake.  I emailed them a  
brief note wishing them luck in the search and a gentle 'heads up' to  
'watch out for people in the fandom that take themselves and their  
fursonas way too seriously' and I got a very nice reply from them today.

So if you know a family and you were interested in being on the show  
- go for it.  They're probably not looking to do an expose on the  
fandom, they just want to show how different people live and what  
happens when you transplant two different types of folks into a pair  
of families for a week; I hardly think its sinister sounding at all.   
Substitute 'star trek fan' for furry and you have a pretty normal  
concept for a show.

   I wouldn't. The media operates on one principle.  "If it bleeds, it 
leads". They've always tried to make fools out of us.

I've gotten the letter too, as a lot of furs have so far. Heather Teta is
googling as many furs as she can find in order to find an interested family.

I believe the email is legitimate but that Teta is being dishonest. My
advice is to watch a few episodes of this show before trying to get
involved. I would also try a google search on "Heather Teta." There are LOTS
of interesting results, including many bloggers' accounts on interacting
with this woman and how she came across them on the web. Most regard her
with high suspicion.

I think if you have a family that's really into furry, and you really really
need the money, then go for it. Just remember that you're risking a LOT of
face. Also, don't think that TV can't make you look foolish even if you're
the coolest family on the planet. Writers know how to take anything and make
it look shitty for the sake of entertainment.

Hope this helps,

This is rather strange. Today I received a message through Frappr Maps

between the age of 5-18. I don't know if it is legitimate or not, but if it

Somehow I can't see a real show spam mailing random furries looking for show 
contestants.  Most of the people I know who've gotten this message don't 
even have a wive/husband, let alone kids!  And this isn't the first time 
I've seen something like this.  I got spammed with a similar request some 
time ago that turned out to be a 100% scam.

The Wife Swap show may be a great show for furries to go on, but I don't 
think this offer is for real.

Why not? Is there an easier way to find people than on the internet? How
else would there even be a furry fandom to begin with?

This isn't the first time I've been emailed by a TV show either. I was asked
by a Dr. Phil writer to be on the show (no money offered); my email address
had been collected months before when I had written in, and it was grouped
in with a particular subject. It was legitimate too: I forwarded the offer
to a friend and he ended up going on.

The only thing I find not to be very easily believable is the money offered.
I imagine the $20,000 is a gimmick to get people to join, and then the
contract they have you sign makes it nearly impossible to collect. That's
just my guess.

Good observations, Tibor

I have a good feeling about it. It could be an
opportunity that would bring fursuiting and
furry people into good light among mainstream

They could be looking a criminal fraud charges if they have no intent of
paying up. No the money would be legit. That is if they are. $20,000 is less
than the lawyers would cost them to defend them self's in the lawsuits that
would follow. In contract law. A heavily lop sided contract will be thrown
out every time. You might not find you like the results but they will pay
up. But if someone decides to do it. They will have to think if there just
getting 30 pieces of silver. But 20k is a lot of money to someone that works
min wage. At min wage your looking at  less than 12k before taxes.

As for my self. I am not acceptable to them. I am not married or have kids.
To tell the truth. I don't know if I would want to have baby goat around.

I'm proably one of the few furs with a kid (step-child from my mate) and we
both agree it would be a bad idea to do such a thing. Just because of how
the media seems to have done with other things involving furry, it could
turn bad since remember your sticking someone else into a household of furs
as well... Also they seem dead set on finding a heterosexual family.
(Remember the godwarrior lady lol..)

It's just around the corner.. MFM is almost here and hopefully you have 
something planned for the Mephit FurMeet's Masquerade.   I have the 
distinct honor of being kinda in charge of the Masq this year.  (Yeah 
me?).  As we don't have a lot of time at the rehearsal, try to have your 
idea's all hammered out and workable.

   I decided that this being the Tenth year of MFM, anyone that can work 
either Tin or Aluminum (which is the traditional gift for a 10th 
anniversary) into their act and make it work will get a special award.  The 
act's don't have to have that in there, but it would just be something fun 
to try to work on.

   Our excellent sound guy Protius is on deck to keep the sound up and 
running.  We would ask that it be standard cd format type of music or sound 
or whatever. It would be good if it was the only song on the disk and that 
he wouldn't need to give it back. Anything else, please ask away off list 
(don't want to flood the list with silly little things, unless it's the 
performance list where things should be discussed..)

Actually, i heard about this on Furtopia. I think it`s a bad idea. If you
have ever seen Wife Swap then you would know nothing good can come from
this. It is just full of drama and makes both families look like crap. Even
if they got a furry family to do this, whether they wanted it or not, they
would be shown as freaks. Becuase that`s what the media wants to see.
This is just my opinion, I really hope they don`t find a family for this.
And if they do, godspeed. I hope i`m wrong.

Heh, you obviously haven't seen the episode with the Christian-hick woman who was screaming bloody murder when she found out the other family weren't Christians. It was....freaky.

  I just find it odd that certain lingo is being used what seems intentionally.

  It is just ignorance is all, I think.

   

  I've seen the show and not once have they tried to make someone look bad. Their goal, imho, is to demonstrate difference in people. No excessive exploiting, or anything like a news article. It is just that people are curious and they want to see something they don't normally see firsthand.

   

  I say go with it, and rarely would I ever suggest that.

TBH, a Furry 'family' would REALLY weird me out. Normally, from what I've seen, The Furry Fandom is populated mainly by those who don't wish to let go of their childhood, much like myself. Raising a family and getting married is most certainly the furthest abandonment from childhood as I can imagine, so seeing a Mother and Father with children who ALL participate would be......kinda strange.

It is true, a friend that's a conchair got a message about it too, 'cause of
his position. Don't remember the exact text, but it wasn't this one, didn't
mention kids at all.

Dear Sir or Madam,

 

I'm a Casting Producer with ABC Television and we're looking for unique
families with unique interests and lifestyles to feature on our primetime
documentary-style programming. I'd love to feature a family who wears and
collects fur suits on "Wife Swap," ABC's family show that allows two very
different families the opportunity to experience a different lifestyle and
while also teaching another family about their own family philosophy. We'd
love to feature families who perhaps perform in the children's entertainment
field - or even families who wear fur suits to ConFurence-type events to
celebrate their love of animals. Whatever the reasoning behind it, we think
fur suits are interesting - and we're betting our viewers do too! Our show
is about showcasing different interests, past times, and sub cultures in
America. We're looking for a really outgoing fun fur suit wearing family who
could bring a lot of fun and whimsy into the lives of another family for a
week. 

 

Please don't be confused by the title - Wife Swap is a family show on ABC
primetime. The premise is simple: two moms from two very different families
get the opportunity to swap lives (but not bedrooms - everyone has their
own!) for a week to experience what it's like to live a different lifestyle
- and to see what they can teach each other about their own! In this case
we're looking to feature outgoing families with unique interests and hobbies
- and all the fun that goes along with it. 

 

All featured families will receive a $20,000 financial honorarium - and
$1000 goes to anyone who refers a family that makes it on the show! We are
looking for two parent families with children (between the ages of 5 and 18)
who are ready for adventure! I appreciate your help with reaching out to
these great families and look forward to hearing from you soon! 

 

Best,

 

Heather Teta

I've only seen the show a couple of times, but they don't seem to ever make 
people look bad.  The whole point of the show seems to be to show people 
that it's ok to be different and to accept differences.

At the very least, there's no way it can be any worse than any of the 
mainstream attention we've gotten so far (MTV...).  I mean it shows on 
primetime BROADCAST...  they aren't going to do anything bad.

Okay

Here's the link that everyone needs to see who hasn't yet: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docidT64505634137914176

That's the show you'll be on. It's actually the FOX version of the show. But it's the same idea: Switching wives between two completely different (but greedy) families.

If you don't expect an individual in a furry family to act that way, you obviously haven't been on the INTERNET very long. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I see emo and suicidally depressed furs on pretty much every page of LJ posts I sift through. I see just as much ignorance in furry as in the rest of the world and I know TV is not afraid to bring out the worst in us.

And it's a REALITY SHOW, guys. Would YOU want to watch a show about a "normal" family? TV wants to make us long as completely different from the rest of the world as possible.

It's a bad idea, and if TV makes you and furry look like crap, you can count on being hated sour right out of the fandom.

Man!

Don't be fooled be the sweet talk.  I've watched wife swap and yeah - 
it's all depressing drama.  This would probably only hurt furry in my  
opinion man.  And besides as someone mentioned - where are you going  
to find a fursuiting 'family'?  just creepy to me.  My opinion is  
that furry should just steer clear of the media alltogether.

Thanks for the vote of confidence Edward - you seem to see there is  
possible good to come from something like this, its nice to know  
there are other people out there that can have a positive viewpoint.

As for the rest of the nay-sayers, I agree that all scenarios of doom  
and gloom are possible:  the intent is to show that furries are sex- 
crazed maniacs that want to have yiff-parties in or out of fursuit  
(or sex with an unworn fursuit - why not blend the fursuit and  
plushie fetishes and break new controversial ground?); show that  
furries are a bunch of emo-whores that will crumble, break apart and  
commit suicide at the first mention of critique or the slightest  
personal attack; or show furries as a tight-knit group that keeps all  
media contact closed off and well controlled through a central  
governing body headed by who else but the furry experts:   con  
chairs.  That last one makes the fandom sound like a hybrid between  
the Montana Freemen and the Branch Dividiots.

Did it ever occur to ANYBODY that the intent of the show was to give  
us a contrast between long island bred waspy family of milquetoast  
morons that are totally non-functional and completely un-lovable from  
the audience's perspective (asshole kids, self-absorbed parents  
consumed by career, young children being completely raised in the  
hands of day-care).

Then offer a 'FURRY' family where the members all chip in and run a  
small organic farm and sell highly successfully branded 'natural  
organic FURRY dairy products' at a premium price to waspy boutique  
gourmet shops all across this great land of ours.  They use tails and  
ears and (gasp) fursuits as part of their marketing of their own  
brand, which they started doing at farmers markets and local fairs to  
(gasp) attract attention to themselves.  By embracing what they love  
about the fandom and not being shy or ashamed about it, they manage  
to take an interest and hobby and show how it can contribute to  
enrich every aspect of their lives (especially financially).  The  
'FURRY' family is more functional, loving, cohesive, and perish the  
thought:  by working on a family farm makes the audience get a warm  
fuzzy feeling (pun intended) about the days gone by from the 50's and  
60's when life was simpler and easy and people were all kind, caring,  
and good (those times never happened by the way - how much did they  
mention the cold war on Happy Days)?

Isn't it possible that the intention of the program is to show that  
an 'alternative' lifestyle that includes some odd hobbies could  
actually be better than what we all have come to expect as the 'great  
american way' of 2.3 kids, dog, house in the suburbs, and 3 SUVs  
parked in the driveway of your 3000sqft McMini Mansion?

Are you people reading your posts?  Do you know how paranoid and doom- 
laden your words sound?  Are you really so ashamed of yourselves and  
what the fandom means to you that you need to build such high walls  
and close yourself off so much?  Are you so used to being a victim  
that the only perspective you can take in life is one full of  
unfounded suspicion, avoidance and damage control?  If this is the  
case then it sure explains a great deal about what I read on  
LiveJournal and what I see when I attend conventions or gatherings.

I'm not saying that the show isn't going to do a furry smear piece -  
I would be deliriously hopeful if I refused to accept that  
possibility; but come on people, does it always have to be such a  
personal attack on YOUR fandom?  Did it ever occur to you that 99.9%  
of the general population doesn't give two shits about who we are and  
what we do?  Did you ever consider that even the 'BAD' media  
attention of the past (whatever you want to call the MTV or CSI or  
whatever else) actually did some good by bringing more people into  
the fandom?  Some of you may have never met your best friends/mate/ 
arch nemesis in the fandom if it weren't for that exposure.

Being prepared for bad press is great - and its the responsible thing  
to do as an adult.  Arming yourself to the teeth assuming the entire  
world is out to get the ONE thing that gives you happiness in this  
life is not being responsible - its actually kind of immature.  It  
might even be a sign of some significant filters on your perceptions  
which likely contribute to your viewpoint on everything in your life,  
not just all things furry.  If you feel miserable, defensive and like  
a victim all the time its possible the person who is attacking you  
the most is yourself, and you may want to consider questioning the  
way you see things in this world sometimes.

Well, first off, are there any fursuit families that
meet their criteria?  I know of individuals and
couples who fursuit, but offhand don't know of any
that meet the kid requirement (unless just having one
adult in the family who fursuits is enough).


Second, no matter how good intentioned or not, it'd
turn out goofy at best.  Interviewing furs has always
leaned towards turning out... not as they pictured it.
 Doing an episode on family life, those making the
show will be sure to push the situation to the more
abnormal side of the spectrum - it's a tv show, it
needs ratings, you get more ratings off Jerry Springer
than a boring documentary showing these 'wacky'
families being too normal - they want the wacky
families to be wacky.

But anyways, people want to do it, that's their
business.  You'll be well known after the fact though
:P

 Well Finnaly got a wolf done and up on the site. 
I suppose the only reason I never did one was because no one
ever commissioned me to make one. Everyone saw me as the 
"cat guy " costume maker.  First production wolf ever for me. 

Anyways, here he is "shadow of the moon"  there is a video that shows the jaw
working and talking. its kinda big and high quality so be patient on the download

let me know what you think

Yeah Ive read the letters and notes.. This just oozes
trouble. Asides finding a furry family is not a easy
task. Expecialy seeing that a large portion of the
fandom is made of single individuals.

Wait

Are you trying to convince us to conform to your opinions or are you just
trying to piss everybody off? You're doing a real good job of the latter.

IMO the fact that you're getting so hyper and dramatic about this just goes
to show how easily a person can be shown in a negative light on television.

Yeah, I agree that the media CAN make us look good. Some writers HAVE. But
before you go accusing all of us of being so ignorant maybe you should
actually watch a few episodes of Wife Swap and Trading Spouses yourself.

The writers always need a point of conflict and they want the audience to
take one side. Otherwise there's no story. So you have about a 50% chance of
the Furry Family being shown as good guys and a 50% chance of being shown
looking like fools.

If you like to gamble maybe this is your thing. Frankly, it's a really
stupid risk to take. I sure as hell wouldn't go near it.

Nope.  Not for a second.

Wow.  Does a 'furry' organic farming family like this exist within this 
fandom?  If they do, I've never heard of them, who are we talking about 
here? (or is this just hyperbole presented for the sake of rose-colored 
argument?)

The whole thing is pretty much moot anyway, as very few furs in the fandom 
have a wife, much the less any kid(s).  And even those that do would be 
unlikely to give up their privacy and risk being lampooned on national TV.
Anyone even remotely intersted should read up on the history of 
the show, it's been around for a few years.  For example:

http://www.realitytvworld.com/wifeswap/
http://www.turnoffyourtv.com/programsratings/wifeswap/wifeswap.html

And of course Wikipedia even has an entry on it:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_Swap

Also, one last note-- "Wife Swap" is on ABC, not CBS.  Odd that the E-mail 
claims that it's on CBS, unless they want to do their own version.
(The E-mail I received about this claimed it was from ABC).

Really nice work..

I'm one of those who interest in costumes is toward realism rather than
toony.

Are you going to make a body for the head as well as I'd bee very interested
to see that also.

Take Care

It looks so realistic and I thought that you had chopped a wolf's head off
to get that (LOL)

I'm a realist also. But since I think of Marcwolf as my first furry mentor
that is not surprising.

I might let you off of my worshiping pedestal some day. But dont hold your
breath. :b

tutorial material for a newbie.  Compressor recommendations are also 
welcome.

Many thanks,

Subject: FL: FC2007 - August Mission Briefing
Message-ID: <20060830230047.GA39256@urocyon.critter.net>


It's summer, all agents, and that means in addition to the end of shedding
season, it's getting on towards the time when mission headquarters starts to
get busy. This month your mission notes are quick and dirty but important to
maximize your chances of success.

In this briefing:
1. Pre-reg Price Increase
2. Travel Assistance Program
3. Web Banner Release
4. Hotel Reservations Issue
5. Conbook Submission Guidelines


1. Pre-reg Price Increase

Effective September 1st, our pre-registration rate increases to $45. So if
your a spy or villain on a budget, use our online registration system
immediately.  If not and you're on an expense account, we'll gladly accept
that extra $5.  You can reach online registration at:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/onlinereg.php>


2. Travel Assistance Program

Help people get to Further Confusion!

Each year, we have some folks who need a little bit of extra help in
affording the trip to Further Confusion. This is your chance to help them
out. The folks listed on this page are folks who have specifically requested
help from the fandom and are people we feel are worthy of your
consideration.

How to request Travel Assistance

If you need just a little help in getting to Further Confusion 2007, we're
here for you! FC can offer travel assistance to those in need. Just e-mail
us at info at furtherconfusion.org (with 'Travel Assistance' in the subject
line), and we'll add you to the list below.

When e-mailing us, make sure that you include your real name, fan name,
mailing address, and provide a brief description about yourself and what you
feel you can contribute to the convention. Note that the deadline for
getting onto the travel assistance list is October 1, 2006.

Donating to the Travel Assistance fund

If you want to make a donation to the convention to help a specific person
listed here, here's how you do it. Send us a check (our address is listed on
our Contacts page) with the name of the individual listed in the memo field
of the check (or money order, as the case may be). We will deposit that
check into our accounts, and on December 5 we will notify the person of the
amount received on their behalf. We will NOT reveal the names of persons who
have made such contributions unless both the recipient and the donor desire
us to.


3. Web Banner Release

You asked for it and our brave graphic design department here at HQ always
supports its agents in the field. Our web banner link is now available at the
following location:

http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/banner.php


4. Hotel Reservations Issue

Due to overwhelming early demand, our room block is out of certain types of
rooms on certain nights. The hotel is not yet sold out. We are working on an
expanded block, so there's no need to panic. However, to allay the concerns
of those of you who can't wait until we get the expanded block increased,
here are directions for you to follow.

When trying to make a reservation, you may be told that you can only get the
convention rate for certain nights and must pay full price for others.

If this happens, please go ahead and make your reservation, then send your
confirmation number and the (real) name on the reservation to
hotel at furtherconfusion.org and let us know. We'll make sure you get our rate
for all days.

We appreciate your patience until the hotel expands the room block.


5. Conbook Submission Guidelines

Once again, our conbook will be an all-color affair, so all you artists with
a flare for spies, get in touch with us. You can contact our conbook staff
at conbook at furtherconfusion.org. The official conbook submission guidelines
will be found here in the next week:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/conbook_guidelines.php>

Also, stay tuned as we hope to announce a contest of interest to those
submitting in our September newsletter. Oh and other agencies, if you want
to run a color advertisement, that's acceptable too.


6. Looking for a few good agents

We are looking for special agents to fill key staff positions. We have
many staff positions open still and we are trying to fill them as soon as
possible. There are many different types of staff positions that are open
and there are several benefits to being staff.

If you are at all interested, email us at hr at furtherconfusion.org (or come
to our next staff meeting) and we'll be happy to talk with you and how you
can help the convention.


7. Next Staff Meeting

Our next staff meeting will be September 16th starting at noon in the San
Jose Doubletree. Parking is free - just tell the parking attendant that
you're with Further Confusion when you arrive, and then get a sticker for
your parking slip in the meeting.


And now, the gadgets...

Oh Great job!

I love the video clip. The jaw movement is really good even with the 
smaller movements when speaking. I think the new way you've rigged the 
jaw is really working out well.

Sorry if this is outside list rules, however this very much concerns suiters. and not everyone reads LJ

I am offering a unique opportunity to have your fursuit appear in a 60 card set of critters.  This is not a free service directly.  I am looking for interested parties to simply pay their portion of the printing and packaging expense.  This money should be returned to you (plus up to a %50 profit) as well as a complete set of the cards for free (for the first 60 suiters) Money would not be collected until January/February time frame, all I need now is a commitment to do so.  

Further details on what you are actually getting and more information on the project please see: http://antimon.livejournal.com/149517.html

In addition to actual fursuiters I'm also looking for 
-Product presales to help some suiters unable to pay all or part of the printing cost

-Artists to design up some package art

-Dealers to offer to sell the cards (starting with Anthrocon 2007)  Committing to selling them gets you listed on the information card going into the 3 card promo packs given away in Anthrocon con bags ((if I can arrange that with the ac staff) (dealers please email me privately for the wholesale prices)

- Makers to purchase an exclusive advertising card to be stuffed into the 10 card packs ($200 for 1200 packs) you can include coupons and stuff

Please note, there is also a sister project run by Concord http://cayuga.livejournal.com/33533.html
This project is for fursuit PLAYING CARDS as in poker, bridge etc

My project is for individual and randomly inserted in packs of baseball/football style trading cards (make excellent badges!)
His project is for a 54 card fully legal playable deck of playing cards featuring fuzzies

Cost to participate in both is separate, both offer returns on your investment and his is substantially cheaper due to the smaller scope of the project.

Thank you for your attention.

  Sorry if this is outside list rules, however this very much concerns suiters. and not everyone reads LJ

  I am offering a unique opportunity to have your fursuit appear in a 60 card set of critters.  This is not a free service directly.  I am looking for interested parties to simply pay their portion of the printing and packaging expense.  This money should be returned to you (plus up to a %50 profit) as well as a complete set of the cards for free (for the first 60 suiters) Money would not be collected until January/February time frame, all I need now is a commitment to do so.  

  Further details on what you are actually getting and more information on the project please see: http://antimon.livejournal.com/149517.html<http://antimon.livejournal.com/149517.html>

  In addition to actual fursuiters I'm also looking for 
  -Product presales to help some suiters unable to pay all or part of the printing cost

  -Artists to design up some package art

  -Dealers to offer to sell the cards (starting with Anthrocon 2007)  Committing to selling them gets you listed on the information card going into the 3 card promo packs given away in Anthrocon con bags ((if I can arrange that with the ac staff) (dealers please email me privately for the wholesale prices)

  - Makers to purchase an exclusive advertising card to be stuffed into the 10 card packs ($200 for 1200 packs) you can include coupons and stuff

  Please note, there is also a sister project run by Concord http://cayuga.livejournal.com/33533.html<http://cayuga.livejournal.com/33533.html>

Message-ID: <20060908033831.74812.qmail@web60924.mail.yahoo.com>

Hey everyone!
   
  This is JD (JappoDawg) Puppy giving a shout out to all the floppy-eared canines out there! ^_^
   
  I just wanted to let everyone know that a bunch of furs around where I am, in the New York-New Jersey area have come together to make an official group called Hi-4! I've appeared at several charity and outdoor functions with a core group of performers, including Rapid T. Rabbit, JimmyWolf as Bobby Bobcat, Foxwell Foxcoon, among other long-standing fursuit performers.
   
  We're just starting out and threw together a little Web site, mostly for the public's view, at www.hi-4.org - It's just a little site that I worked with someone to throw together, and we always welcome feedback and promotion, so feel free to contact the entire HI-4 group at comments at hi-4.org!
   
  Anyway, it contains some photos of our most recent events and activities, and also has some info about ourselves. Again if you have any suggestions or comments about the site, let us know!
   
  Mmkay - This puppy's out!

Well, Hi-4 is really centered around the New York CITY Metropolitan area,  
which would also include Northern/Central New Jersey, Long Island, Westchester  
County (plus Rockland/Putnam/Dutchess etc. counties) and Southwestern CT  
(Fairfield/New Haven counties).
 
Utica is one of the way upstate NY Northern tier cities far West of Albany  
going towards Syracuse.

[Please pardon the x-posting]

Hello Friends!

There are TWO weeks to go before pre-registration ends for the Western 
Pennsylvania Furry Weekend! http://www.wpafw.org.  Two weeks before you miss 
out on up to $10 in savings you can keep by registering early.   Don?t wait 
any longer.  Don?t miss that pre-registration deadline of 12:01AM September 
23, 2006.

? Basic level Pre-registration is $15. (Gets you into the Friday Furry 
Social, and the Fur-b-que and Prowl and Growl on Saturday.)
? Supporter level Pre-registration is $20. (All of the above plus front line 
privilege for food at the Fur-b-que, five Charity Raffle tickets, our 
esteemed gratitude, and other swag.)

Time is also running out to reserve a room at the hotel at the flat Furry 
Weekend rate of $69.99!  After September 22, all room rates go back to the 
normal $85 a night, double occupancy, plus extra for each additional 
occupant.  You?ll be missing out on over $15 worth of savings.

That?s at least $25 in savings you can?t afford to pass up!  So what are you 
still waiting for???

You?ll let yourself miss out on a mile stone year for this event, now in 
it?s sixth year, which has secured a 500 square foot meeting room at the 
Comfort Inn Pittsburgh North for our Friday Furry Social and for our 
Saturday Night Prowl and Growl.

If you procrastinate you?ll miss meeting this year?s ?Featured Artist? the 
renowned Shawntae Howard, writer and illustrator for the popular 
?Extinctioners? comic book. http://www.extinctioners.com

And don?t pass up your opportunity to help out our Furry Weekend Charity 
Animal Friends, Pittsburgh?s only no-kill animal shelter, and pick up one of 
over 25 furry themed gifts and commissions that are being raffled off to 
raise money for our worthy charity.

This by no means conveys all the information available on this year?s event. 
I encourage you to visit the Western PA Furry Weekend website at 
http://www.wpafw.org for everything you need to know about pre-registering, 
weekend programming and activities, as well as important information on 
securing lodging at the event rate. I also invite you to sign up for the 
Furry Weekend Forums where you can also get the latest information on the 
event, pose questions and suggestions, and hook up with your friends for 
room and ride shares.

So mark your calendars and register now to join us in the beautiful autumn 
clad foothills of the Allegheny Valley and see friends old and new.

The Western Pennsylvania Furry Weekend, October 6th, 7th & 8th, 2006!!

You might be a furry if you wake up finding an animal head in your bed and
you like it

You might be a furry if you put an animal head in your bed for your mate to
wake up to find and you think he/she will like it

I thought of that after all of the times that my BF found my fursuit heads
in bed with him and he complained *He is not a fur* What is a fur to do when
ones heads when one is not using his head in a small appartment?

No that would be a geek than a fur. And yes there are a lot of furries that
are also major geeks.

My favorite, and the one that got the biggest laugh at a convention, is:

If you don't know your ten best friends' real names . . .
. . . you might be a furry.

I saved this from a while back:

o You receive a letter from  S C Johnson Co. (makers
of Enbac)
personally thanking you for the support of their
product.

o When undressing you instinctively reach for the
zipper in the back.

o You have a headshot of your fursuit on your driver's
license/state ID.

o You feel naked without your fursuit.

o You know your fellow fursuiters more by the names of
the characters
they play than their real names.

o You find yourself using pantomine rather than
talking to get your
point across.

o You think nothing of subsisting for months on water
and Ramen Noodles
(tm) to be able to afford that new fursuit you want.

o You go to an amusement park just to hang out with
the costumed
characters.

o You're so used to the limited vision that your
fursuit provides that
you will often bump into things and trip on things
even when out of your
fursuit.

o You don't have any childern, yet you have videotapes
of programs such
as Barney and Friends, Bear in the Big Blue House,
Dumbo's Circus,
Rimba's Island, and Welcome to Pooh Corner.

when you go out trick or treating in your fursuit and
end up with more 
candy then your neighbors kids :)

- You see kids on the street and say, "Boy, I wish I
brought *name of
character* along for the ride!"

- You tuck your fursuit tail inside your pants when
you go to work (feline
tails mainly, try to hide a fox or skunk tail down
there.)

- You express love, sadness, anger and fear, all with
a permanant smile
drawn on your face out of costume.

- You get caught talking to the case containing your
costume, addressing it
as the name of your character.

- People start thinking you're gay just because you
give hugs and pounce
anything that moves (male fursuitters mainly).

- You travel 4 hours to a remote town to see a local
festival, just in case
they have a costumed character parading in the
streets.

- You have tapes of all christmas parades (Disney or
otherwise) for the last
ten years.

- You can't name at least three players on your local
sports team, but can
recite the name of all mascots of all NBA, NFL and NHL
teams (including
those who NEED a mascot!  Can't believe the Montreal
Canadians still don't
have one!)

- A co-worker calls your name, and you turn around,
lean your body in his
direction, and bring your hand to your ear...  which
is no longer on top of
your head.

- You've been to all costumed character shows, such as
Pok?mon the Musical,
and Rugrats Live!.

- You've brought a new meaning to the words, "Is it
me, or is it hot in
here?"

- You only use smileys to express yourself in a chat
room.  ;-)

- You bought yourself a mini-van, just because it
could give you room if you
need to get changed on the road.  (Undressing's easier
than getting the
pieces together in such a cramped-up space)

- Every time a new animation movie gets out, you plan
to go to its studio's
theme park to see the character come to life.

-  Furs start to worship your fursuit and could care
less about the
person inside.

 You get  s-mail as well as e-mail addressed to your
character instead of you,

Your parking permit for a event has your character
names on it instead 
of yours.

when youre at an amusment park and you are around the
characters and you 
instinctively adjust their fur around their neckline

You quit your heathclub, due to the fact you get a
better workout in your suit!

I just wear my fox tail out in the open.  everyone I talk to thinks it's
really funny (at least at school)

Its funny how things you say and do a while ago keeps coming back.

Both lines below I posted to the list when this subject came up several 
years ago

  I get regular mail addressed to BJ Buttons all of the time.
Look at the return e-mail address of this post :)

and I did a relay for life event a few years ago. The team that I was with 
was called the Sleepy time bears. so having me there in suit worked. The 
group even had there own lap around the track at 1 am called walk with the 
bear. The event had arranged for me to get parking close to the track since 
I was performing in suit as well as working as security when I wasn't in 
suit/ The pass I got for the van, yes I bought a van so there would be a 
place to haul around the furry stuff and in a pinch change into the suit 
:), the pass had BJ Buttons" listed instead of my real name.

I'm writing to let everyone know about the original fursuit database which Radjin and Timduru are running.  It's located at http://www.fur-suit.org/  It's been running for a while now but I'm fairly sure that there are quite a few folks who still don't know about it.  This is a user friendly and fully searchable site created to capture the best representation of  your fursuits for future posterity.

it is a good site but the "user friednly' aspect needs some work but we'll see what the 2.0 interface is like :)

the fursuit trading card project request that the suiter joins both data bases currently in operation and posts links for both on the cards

well anyone is free to give suggestions (off this list as to not spam it )
as to what they think is good or not good, and what could be better ;)
I've not heard problems with user friendlyness so far beside minor changes
and more features that will come, but you are sure welcome to add your 2
cents :)

ok, well since it's posted here,
I might as well add some more infos and things that might be of interest
for this list.  :)

As far as I know this list is mostly about performance and construction
and fursuits as piece of art. :)


So the Fursuit Database, can help all that at a certain level :)

It'll keep fursuits data and history, so that the suits and infos are not
'lost' for the future, kinda like the fursuit archive, but not only on a
photo level, it has all the infos :)

I'll just list a few examples that might be of interest here, but
possibilities are endless with the combined criterias :)
Keep in mind that even if it's a fully functionnal "basic version",
it's far from beeing finished, and there are many features and things
coming still :)


**Construction**

I tried to write the search engine with that part in mind too.
There are many criterias that can be usefull for that.

For example if you are making your own fursuit, let's say a fox , and are
looking for
fox fursuits for reference, based on mesh heads, that are mostly
reaslistic and have
digitigrade legs ?

Well easy , just select all those criterias on the search page and hit
search, you'll then get the list of suits matching these criterias. :)

You can do so with many other criterias pertaining to construction :)
3D eyes, head types, suit types, etc..
I'll reorganise the criterias better as they are growing. ;)

**Buying**
You're going to buy a suit of a certain species, but not sure who to
commission ?
well just search for all suits of that species, and then see which builder
fits more what you are looking for , then just go to their website for
more infos once you've choosen :)



**Performance**
suiters have the hability to list their suits as 'available for
performing'

So you can also search for those available for performing :)
let's say that for a particular event, you are looking for wolf costumes,
in California, but which are 75% toony or more as to not scare childrens ?
Well , again just fill in all those criterias and you'll get the results

**Finding a suit**
you've seen a suit at a convention, you know it's a wolf,  and would like
to contact the owner
/ builder, but are unsure who it was  ?
well search all suits who attended that convention and are a wolf, fill in
any other criteria to pin point more, or just list :)

**Suiters**
well it's a good place to keep your suit datas and history in the DB, so
that you can point others to the infos, and keep track of the suit history
:)



Well I'm not going to list all , but possibilities are endless,
and if you think there's something missing or  a major feature missing
don't hesitate to contact me to give your suggestions :)

I need to take a small break from all the coding I had in the past few
months on the site,
but features will be added as my time permit.
And the 2nd more eye candy and dynamic interface will be coming too
(Yakeo will be working on the design and I'll do the rest  )

Well thanks for reading,
and unless it's remarks pertaining to the subject of this list,
better take it on the site's LJ or in private emails as to not spam the
list.
Thanks :)

Hi.

Have just signed onto the Fursuit Database myself.

Looks to be an excellent idea and I'm looking forward to putting up the
history of my suit creation as he has gone throught a few re-hashes - esp in
the legs area as he is a faux-digitgrade (looks digitgrade but with a
plantigrade wearer)

Take care all

Marcwolf

Growl,

I went looking around for the entries I made for Ashes and for Rocky and I 
thought I uploaded them to Fur-suit.org when it was first opened.

Now it seems there's no record of either of the two fursuits I enrolled in 
the site.  Did the site lose information when it was updated to the new 
search engine or is there a third fursuit database out there that I can no 
longer find?

Thanks for looking into this.

well better not, that'll mess up some of the current layout if you
increase too much ;)
The 2nd design will scale better normally.
I've increased the fonts a little in the meantime :)
But it's getting difficult to get everything to fit with all the info to
display ;)

PS:better direct remarks that are not for this list
directly onto the site's LJ or by private email.
Thanks :)

I need a List to small list of tutorials on how to make body suits, tails and maybe feet. Part of this is for a friend that poped on asked me to help find some sources. Thanks for reading help would be kindly appreciated.

Try the memories section on
http://community.livejournal.com/fursuit/

It's full of tons of resources. And then there's
always the good old list at fursuit.org.

I'd suggest Matrices' site, but it seems to be down
for me (anyone else?).

And there's Brokken's website too, which shows a good
way on how to build foam musclesuits.
http://www.timberwolf.org

But I strongly suggest checking out fursuit.org and
the Livejournal fursuit community.

Try searching for it on Google and clicking the
'cached' link right under the links for each
individual page on her site. It's better than nothing,
and is what I usually do.

I'm looking for a material I can use that will look
like leather for some imitation armor for a costume. 
Can anyone recommend something that would work?  Need
a dark walnut hue.  I'm assuming leather would be a
bit costly, so I'm seeking a substitute.

Hey patch,

If you've got a Tandy Leather branch in your area I'd suggest giving 
them a try, you'd be surprized what you can get from the scrap bins for 
not too much money, I've gathered enough of the same type of leather to 
make shoes and boots for the SCA, and friends have gotten enough to make 
full body armor.  Scrap leather is much cheaper than new naugahide or 
vinyl.  You might also want to check out flea markets and yard sales, my 
mom makes teddy bears from old leather jackets.

Message-ID: <20060928160953.GA78754@urocyon.critter.net>

Fall is just around the corner and it's time for a new briefing to all agents.
We're putting out the call for lots of things this time and look forward
to seeing all your best new techniques and sharing of information with
fellow agents in our vast tracks of programming. So without further ado,
here's the latest news. Please update your cached encrypted archives as
this email might self destruct in 30 seconds (or 3, our technical branch
has been having a few quality control issues with everyone on vacation.)

5.  Conbook Announcement
6.  FNL Reminder

               -------------------------------------------

1.  Hotel Status and Overflow Hotel Announcement

Due to overwhelming early demand, our host hotel - the San Jose
Doubletree - is almost completely sold out of rooms. There are only a
handful left on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. Since it is so early,
we hacked into the appropriate mainframe and managed to get an overflow
hotel:

We now have a contracted room block at the Hyatt San Jose hotel, which is
just 0.2 miles from the Doubletree. Rooms are available from Wednesday the
17th thru Monday the 22nd, with a precious 1 reservation available on the
23rd (act fast if you want it!).  The Hyatt, which will officially become
a Holiday Inn at the end of September, offers the following:

 . Free Parking
 . Free airport shuttle
 . Free in Room Internet
 . Rooms for up to four occupants

For more information on hotel amenities, visit 
<http://www.hyattsanjose.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/index.jsp>.

Making a reservation at the Hyatt/Holiday Inn:

Price:  $114/night.  Yes, more than the DoubleTree, but still really cheap
considering standard Bay Area rates.

Reservations:  Call (800) 233-1234 or (888) 975-1234.  Specify "Further
Confusion" as the Group when requesting a room or you will not get the
convention rate.

This is a limited block so please act quickly.  We're sorry, but at this
point we cannot process special room requests (there is no such thing as a
"fursuit floor" at the Hyatt) or offer a shuttle service between hotels.
Thankfully, its within pretty easy walking distance. 

You can find all this information and more on the hotel page:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/hotel.php>


2.  GOH Announcement for Jerry Pournelle

Further Confusion is pleased to announce that our second GOH for FC2007
will be none other than award winning novelist and scientist, Jerry
Pournelle. We are sure that all the evil geniuses will look forward to
picking his brain for the latest developments in science, technology, and
anthropomorphic alien elephant invasion scenarios.

For all the information on Mr. Pournelle, you can find his full biography
at:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/guests.php>


3.  Silicon Room Party

Shaken or Furred? The FC2007 Room party at Silicon is a go. If you are
in the Bay Area or planning to attend Silicon, please drop by and visit us
on October 7, 2006 from 8pm til we run out of Martini mixers or the
Chairwoman decides enough is enough.

Shaken or Furred?
FC2007 Silicon Room Party
October 7, 2006 8 pm
Room 243 San Jose Doubletree Hotel
Silicon Membership is not required but they sure can use the support and
have a reasonable day membership for $20

More info on Silicon can be found at:

<http://www.siliconventions.com/>


4.  Masquerade Announcement

Our fearless masquerade folks are up and running. This year we're
announcing a new level for the Masquerade! There will be the standard
levels like usual; Novice, Journeyman, and Master. And if you've won in
the past, you may do so again at the same level as last time! And don't be
afraid anymore of going up against professionals, because now they've got
their own category. Also, judging will be mainly on construction, so you
MUST be at the rehearsal to present your suit. Please see the website for
more information at:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/masqinfo.php>


5.  Conbook Announcement

Our conbook submissions guidelines are now up and available. Remember, our
book is once again all color this year, so we can accept color as well as
black and white submission. The deadline for submitting art or written
materials is November 1, 2006. We also have room for a couple of short stories
and other written materials. For all the info please see the following:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/conbook_guidelines.php>


6.  FNL Reminder 

Get ready your spy gear, decoder rings and undercover disguises, Agents!
Furry Night Live is back again on Sunday night as the number one place to
see furry variety acts performed live. Break out the shoe phone and deploy
those dashing agents, femmes fatales, and thuggish hench-bears. Your
mission, should you choose to accept it: Assemble your secret forces to
put together an act or skit fitting the spy theme "Fur Your Eyes Only."
Are you a Rogue Agent with no act or skit?  Not an Impossible Mission! Our
crack team of operatives will have scripts, acts, and skits for you to
participate in. For more information contact Furry Night Live Lead, Yippee
Coyote, at fnl at furtherconfusion.org. To subscribe to the official Furry
Night Live discussion E-mail list go to
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/fnl_signup.php>


7.  Pre-Reg Price Increase

Effective September 1st, our pre-registration rate has increased to $45.
Pre-registration will be available at that price until December 30th.  You
can reach online registration at: 

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/onlinereg.php>


8.  Badge Art Wanted!

Further Confusion is currently seeking artwork submissions for the 2007
membership badge inserts. Both color and black & white artwork will be
accepted, and all artwork will be considered on overall 'look and feel',
plus these additional points:

 . Size: Art must scale to be printed at 4" x 2".
 . Theme: Art must accurately reflect the theme of the con.
 . Age appropriateness: The art must be suitable for viewing by children.

Artists submitting images should be aware that there is no payment for
badge art chosen, and the artist gives Further Confusion the right to
reproduce the image as badge art for FC2007. The artist will be credited
on the insert and in the con program book. The artist retains all other
copyrights and reproduction rights beyond the above.

Submission deadline is November 1st, 2006. All qualifying submissions will
be seriously considered and we will choose 6 designs. All artists will be
notified by December 1st as to whether or not their submissions have been
chosen.

For more information, please see
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/badgeart.php>


9.  Dealer's Room

There were ten half-table spaces offered to people on the Dealers Room
waiting list at the beginning of August.  Not all of the dealers who were
offered the spaces accepted, so we still have a small number of spaces
open.  These will be offered again on November 1st by random drawing to
those on the waiting list at that time.  If you want to take part in the
random drawing for a half table in the dealers room, you should fill out
the waiting list form which is linked from the Dealer's Room website at
<http://furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/dealers.php> and send it back to us so
that it arrives before the November 1st deadline.


10. Furry Market Place

The first round of Furry Market Place space offers is closed, and we
filled all the spaces that we had available.  The next round will open on
November 1st, when we will be offering another 10 spaces.  These spaces
will be offered on a first-come first-served basis.  You should note that
any second round requests postmarked before November 1st will be _put
at the back of the queue_.  More details will follow in the October
mission briefing.


11. Art Show

Art Show Panel Requests are now open! We are selling out quickly and are
at about 50% of our total capacity at present. Please go to
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/artshow.php> for announcements and
further information, or send in a request for an information packet to
artshow at furtherconfusion.org.


12. FCTV Submissions sought out

Its that time of year again. Have some nifty furry video or show you'd
like to see on FCTV? Well now's the time to start the submittal process!
Right now anything with a PG or lower rating is on the table, so submit
away! Any length, any format. To submit, just send an e-mail to
fctv at furtherconfusion.org with information on your submission and we'll
take it from there! Also feel free to e-mail if there's something you
yourself didn't make, but would like to see on FCTV! We'll reach out to
content creators ourselves if we have to! Deadlines for major content
submission is November 31st (we need time to prepare it all), so if you've
got that great video idea, get filming!


13. Panelists and Panels

Our devious programming track leads are rapidly filling up the schedule to
give you too many choices once again. If you have an idea for a panel you
would like to see or run, please drop a line to
events at furtherconfusion.org. The deadline for panel ideas is November 1 (So
that we can make sure we get the panelists credit in the con book) so act
soon.


14. Next public meeting

Our next staff meeting will be October 14th starting at noon in the San
Jose Doubletree. Parking is free - just tell the parking attendant that
you're with Further Confusion when you arrive, and then get a sticker for
your parking slip in the meeting.


Oh, shush.

I always add a doubled-over layer of ultrasuede for eyelids at top and
bottom and just glue down the fur to that, shaping it around as I go.

HI I am not sure what your eyes are made of if they are plastic then pull the fur into the hole and glue down on the foam inside. I reinforse the fur with product called goop. but hot glue should work too. If the eyes are screen run a bead of hot glue around the edge of the screen and fold the edge of the fur on to it.. We sew the fur to the sreen eyes and then add them to the foam. Hope some of that helps.

This info is good and will help me on another mask but it's not what I ment. 
I'm sorry I wasn't specific enough but I was talking about the use your own 
eyes masks I'm having a problem because the mask is a little further from my 
eyes than I expected and I need a way to bridge the gap so it dose not seem like 
it just has two holes in the face.

Hey y'all!

I found this via Fark today, and saw that it could easily fire off all 
sorts of claw-type thoughts:

  http://www.muc.muohio.edu/~natedogg/main.htm

I thought I'd share that with fellow suiters here as I know that quite a 
few have the ability to make these.

Heres a thought of my own for building retractable animal claws: Use a 
shoulder harness much like the ones that amputees use to open and close 
their hooks: stretch the back, claws come out. Relax, claws retract.

Have fun!

Hi all!

I'm performing live at an amateur singing contest in my home town of
Southampton, and I'm singing "Hungry like the Wolf" by Duran Duran. I plan
to impress the judges by ripping open my shirt during the bridge and
revealing a huge wolf decal on an undershirt. However, I'd also like to howl
convincingly. Can anyone who suits or role-plays as a wolf perhaps give me
some help on how to perfect a wolf howl?

Thanks, Hedgie

  Hey Hedgie,
 
 First thing I'd do is download a bunch of soundclips. Try a place like findsounds.com or just hop onto ye olde Google and try searching around. Listen to the clips and try and mimic it, and even "sing along" and try to match it as best you can. 
 
 Good luck, sounds like a fun event

hey there Super BH for me before I begin to howl like a wolf I listen to my Halloween sound effects and when I  hear some wolves howling I listen to them a few times before I begin to howl just like them so get yourself a halloween sound track on Cassette or CD (what ever works better for you) but make sure it has wolves howling on it before you buy it cuz I bought some off brands before and I barely heard any wolves howling on it, or you can download it from a program like I use Limewire and I search for howling wolves or something like that and I get it, so you can you a program almost like what I use to download music or anything like it would do so this native american dark wolf wishes you the best of luck.

One thing to remember is that no matter how you say "Ah-oooo", it's never going to come out. The proper pronunciation is "arrrr-ooooooo", but the "oo"ounds still has to keep that 'R" sound. (Kepp your jaw back for that, and experiment with how you place it). Also, stay in a diaphram-voice until you reach the "oo" part, switch into headvoice and do not worry about getting a clear sound; you want it to sound almost husky and wolf-like. Try these tips out; I hope they help.

  Hi all!

I'm performing live at an amateur singing contest in my home town of
Southampton, and I'm singing "Hungry like the Wolf" by Duran Duran. I plan
to impress the judges by ripping open my shirt during the bridge and
revealing a huge wolf decal on an undershirt. However, I'd also like to howl
convincingly. Can anyone who suits or role-plays as a wolf perhaps give me
some help on how to perfect a wolf howl?

Thanks, Hedgie

  For crying out loud... I can understand putting out a message saying "Looking for a female suiting partner" or "just curious, but how many females are there in the fandom" or something else suit-related, but out-and-out announcing that you're looking for a MATE?! Jeez. One- this is a fursuit list, as Moonstone so rightly pointed out. Two, what woman worth her salt is going to even respond to such an impersonal request? 

  You want a female, furry mate? Try chatting up someone at a con, be sweet, offer to buy her a drink, but for gosh-sakes, don't go hunting one on a mailing list! 

  This message was brought to you by AnimeCat, who is- OMG- female and furry and proud of it.

Can we end this thread, please?!
It's getting us no where, generating pointless traffic that eats up bandwidth that is donated to this list by several generous indiviuals who run this server.

At this point, I think we have embarressed Trevor Hyland enough as it is.

Meeep~



It's been a while since I last posted here, but I wanted to let everyone 
know that we've updated our NorthFur FX & Mascots website (so it's not 
completely dead)  We've updated it with new photos, updated prices and lots 
of new latex prosthetics.

Check out the Dolphin Muzzle sculpted by Kippofur :D



We have a tail sale and more going on.

We've even finally registered a domain name too:  http://www.northfur.ca



Have a look and let me know if there are any broken links please~

I went to a fursuit/costuming site sometime this summer, and I can't remember the URL or the name for it. It had a lion headpiece (a reference to Aslan) which was incredibly realistic, several latex things, an Anubis fursuit that had a gold helmet for the head as well as an actual fursuit head, plus the makings of a dragon mask that wasn't finished. There were also non-furry costumes as well. If anyone has any idea as to what the site is, I'd really appreciate if you could send me the URL. Thanks!

>I went to a fursuit/costuming site sometime this summer, and I can't remember the URL or the name for it. It had a lion headpiece (a reference to Aslan) which was incredibly realistic, several latex things, an Anubis fursuit that had a gold helmet for the head as well as an actual fursuit head, plus the makings of a dragon mask that wasn't finished. There were also non-furry costumes as well. If anyone has any idea as to what the site is, I'd really appreciate if you could send me the URL. Thanks!

Most likely option is Primal Visions, at http://www.primalvisions.com/

While I myself hope to one day meet in RL a nice fem fur that I could become close to, I can really sympathize with the furry ladies here on the net.  Just look at what happened to Sabrina here. :D

How many of you ladies have had to put of with that? ;)

And now, back to our regularly scheduled fursuiting.

  For crying out loud... I can understand putting out a message saying "Looking for a female suiting partner" or "just curious, but how many females are there in the fandom" or something else suit-related, but out-and-out announcing that you're looking for a MATE?! Jeez. One- this is a fursuit list, as Moonstone so rightly pointed out. Two, what woman worth her salt is going to even respond to such an impersonal request? 

  You want a female, furry mate? Try chatting up someone at a con, be sweet, offer to buy her a drink, but for gosh-sakes, don't go hunting one on a mailing list! 

  This message was brought to you by AnimeCat, who is- OMG- female and furry and proud of it.

Yup, get it quite a bit. Especially when I'm wearing a
male fursuit. It's like they can sense my boobs under
all that fur and padding. x_x

Not whining, just asking politely. Spelling properly

Wow.  Trevor, you must have never made it to a furry convention.  There 
are plenty of women in fandom, though it wasn't always that way.  Sadly, 
all the ones I seem to find are attached, underage or just nucking futz. 
  Makes me wonder if all the good available women go hide whenever I 
walk nearby.

Telain & Omen, there is one good benefit to being shorter than most. 
You don't hit your head on all sorts of overhanging branches, shelves, 
etc.  I'm 6'0" tall, and I can't tell you how many times I've smacked my 
head on something and had my shorter friends laugh at me.

There's a benefit and downside to everything.  The key is looking at the 
brighter side now & then.  :)

>I went to a fursuit/costuming site sometime this summer, and I can't remember the URL or the name for it. It had a lion headpiece (a reference to Aslan) which was incredibly realistic, several latex things, an Anubis fursuit that had a gold helmet for the head as well as an actual fursuit head, plus the makings of a dragon mask that wasn't finished. There were also non-furry costumes as well. If anyone has any idea as to what the site is, I'd really appreciate if you could send me the URL. Thanks!

Most likely option is Primal Visions, at http://www.primalvisions.com/

Yea, I flipped a car and the crushed ceiling would've killed anyone more
than a few inches taller than me. I don't mind being short anymore, after
not growing for 5 years, you get used to it.

In a (slight) effort to bring things back on topic.

At least to me, when I see a small petite person (male or female) in  
fursuit, they bring
about a realism and life to their character that is,.....very special.

Now, I'm by no means overweight, or excessively tall (5', 10") but I  
wish I was alot smaller
and full of energy to give my character (if you may) the life and  
spirit that I feel inside.

Oh well, I guess I fursuit for different reasons than most on this  
list do :P

Subject: FL: BIG FUN, NO WHAMMIES! #2 - Megaplex 2007 News - October 2006
Message-ID: <4521F75D.7090208@pawpet.org>

Popping up like a Daily Double in your mailbox, it's time for the latest
news on Megaplex 2007!

Florida's furry arts and entertainment convention is back for another
spin, and this time, we're bringing the fun to the First Coast!
Megaplex 2007 will be held on March 2-4, 2007, at the Wyndham
Jacksonville Riverwalk, in Jacksonville, Florida.

LET'S MEET OUR GUEST OF HONOUR!

Megaplex 2007 is happy to announce that Mike Kazaleh will be joining us
as Guest of Honour this year!  Mike is a professional animator and
comics artist; old-school furry fans will remember his comics work on
"The Adventures of Captain Jack" (Fantagraphics), and "Mean Green Bondo
Machine" and "The Suit" (MU Press).  He has also drawn "Ren and Stimpy"
for Marvel, "Cow and Chicken" for DC Comics, and "The Mighty Mutanimals"
for Archie Comics, and is currently working on "Futurama" for Bongo
Comics and "Camp Lazlo" for DC.

Animation-wise, his credits include "The New Adventures of Mighty
Mouse", "Tiny Toon Adventures", and "The Simpsons"; more recently, he
has worked on "Krypto the Superdog", "Johnny Test", and "Hi Hi Puffy Ami
Yumi".  He was also a storyboard artist for the recent release, "The Ant
Bully".

Please join us in welcoming Mike to Megaplex 2007!

HAVE YOU VISITED THE WEBSITE LATELY?

If not, you're missing out on a really cool design job, courtesy of one
Jess "Lynxcat" Kiela, our talented art director.  As the fellows in that
one commercial put it, "Brilliant!"

What can you do on http://www.ppmp.info/ ?  Well, you can register for
the convention, order your con t-shirt, reserve your dealer's room
table(s), and purchase con book advertisements and personals!  Not to
mention, we'll be updating the site regularly with news and notes to get
you ready for the con.

Also, keep an eye on our "megaplex" community on LiveJournal, for
additional information from not only the staff of Megaplex, but our
members as well!  That site is http://megaplex.livejournal.com/ .

WHAT ARE T-SHIRTS, ALEX?

We will have Megaplex 2007 t-shirts...more info on the design is coming
soon.  In the meantime, be sure to order yours when you register - we
won't have that many available beyond what is ordered, and if last year
was any indication, the extras will go fast!

T-Shirts are $12 for Small through 2X-Large when pre-ordered.

DEALERS ROOM TABLES!

Our members asked for it, so Megaplex is bringing back a traditional
Dealer Room in 2007! Bring your art, comics, clothing, DVDs - whatever
you'd like to show! Table reservations can be made when you register for
the convention. Full tables are only $40 apiece (limit two) - grab one
for yourself, or find a partner to share.

Either way, reserve early! Space is limited - first come, first served!

Please remember the rating! All materials being displayed publicly must
be no more than PG-rated. Applying labels or other coverings in order to
conceal its objectionable portions will not be acceptable.

BOO!

Furloween is coming up October 28th...check out
http://www.floridafurs.com/furloween/ for more information.  While
you're at Furloween, be sure to pick up your Megaplex 2007
flyer...there'll be a code on the flyer that will get you $5 your base
membership at Megaplex, if you register with the code by November 30th!

(To Keep The Insurance Folks Happy : Furloween is operated by Patrick
"Mach" Dowden; Pawpet Live Experiences, Inc. is in no way involved with
the operation of the event.)

WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR #1?

It's time to play!  This year, we're working up a Game Show theme that
is sure to entertain.  If you have an idea for a panel or event that
fits into our theme for 2007, drop us a line at
megaplex-feedback at pawpet.org .  We want your feedback on exactly what
you want to see at the convention, and we want to get with folks who
would like to run said panels and events.  Megaplex is ultimately the
members' convention, so help make it the best it can be!

We're always on the lookout for volunteers, as well.  Drop us a note if
you'd like to help out in March.

HOTEL RESERVATIONS OPEN!

This year, Megaplex 2007 will be held at the Wyndham Jacksonville
Riverwalk, in downtown

(MOSH), Friendship Park, and River City Brewing Company, which can
easilly be reached via the Riverwalk.  The hotel is also a stop for the
S.S. Marine Taxi service (http://www.jaxwatertaxi.com), which is a
convenient way to get to the shops and restaurants at the Jacksonville
Landing (http://www.jacksonvillelanding.com).  The San Marco shopping
district is close by, and Five Points and Riverside are just over the
Fuller Warren Bridge (I-95 to Park Street).  Jacksonville International

go-round; check our web page for directions.  Meet us in the lobby!

Before that, we're inviting folks to check out one of the cooler spots
in Jacksonville...the Jacksonville Zoo!  We'll meet up at 12:00pm at the
main gate of the zoo.  Admission is $11.00 (10% discount for AAA members
and military personnel).  We'll prowl the zoo, and answer questions
about Megaplex and the Jacksonville area as we go.  Directions to the
Jacksonville Zoo can be found at
http://www.jaxzoo.org/visit/directions.asp .

If you're not in the area, come chat with us!  We use the same IRC
server as the Funday Pawpet Show does - irc.pawpet.org 6667.  We'll be
in the #megaplex channel on most Sunday nights, during the Funday Pawpet
Show (7pm-11pm EDT), and we'll have weekday evening meetings open to the
public as well (watch this space).  If you want to learn more about
Megaplex, find out how you can help out, or just meet and greet, please
join us!

STAY TUNED!

Keep an eye on http://www.ppmp.info/ and
http://megaplex.livejournal.com/ for the latest news and information,
and please do not hesitate to drop us a line at
megaplex-feedback at pawpet.org (or to me directly at mp-ceo at pawpet.org) if

I know how you feel. I`m 6`2". I`d love to be around you`re height though. I
hate being tall.

And I agree, short fur suiters seem to give more life to there characters.
Then again, it might be becuase you rarely ever see tall suiters running and
jumping and such.

As a 5'1" fursuiter, I'd have to concur on that feeling ;-)

> proportions like roopert

I think the best thing about being short is that I can play virtually any size character that I want to build around my frame.  Santa Fox the fursuit character is just an inch or so taller than me, so he mimics my build exactly.  Roarke the Stork, with his long neck, stands nearly seven feet tall.  Rantula the Tarantula is large and wide, expanding around me in all directions.  I can pretty much build a costume to extend my body in any direction that I want to, opening up all kinds of possibilities that aren't available to taller or more heavyset fursuiters.

Rather than take up any more space in people's inboxes, I'll provide a link to an essay I wrote a while back about being small.  Hopefully it will be helpful to those smaller fursuiters out there who might be feeling a little frustrated about their size.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

IM little both ways but a little bulky the problem with fursuits in they make 
muscle look like fat which in turn makes the body and head uneven, 
unfortunately there aren't many materials that have fur and stretch, (well there are but 
they will cost ya and I don't think every one can afford that.but realism is 
kind of relative, It depends when i see a realistic fursuit but a huge head it 
looks a little off.Especialy on a smaller person.but when you see one thats 
evenly sized to the separate parts and the suiter's height it really looks 
great.

Personally I wish I was taller and ligher build.

I am about 5'7 and of a stocky build.  My mcharacter is about 6' plus and
has a swimmer's build.

It has meant that when I built him I had to basically make a upper muscle
suit to give the should to hip ratio

Ah well - we can only work with what we are given.

Take care all

I like the size I am: 5'7" @135#. Clothes and shoes are easy to find.
Airplane seats are no problem at all. And there are lots of costumes
that I can fit into:) Plus, it's easier to make me look bigger with
more padding then it would be to make a larger person appear smaller:)

Subject: FL: digigrade legs
Message-ID: <c23fb4800610032127w77ff5101x29231e59315217e1@mail.gmail.com>

I've been thinking about the 'hind legs of canine, feline and saurian
'suits. There are alot of versions of digigrade legs out there. Most
seem bulky and out of proportion with the rest of the costume. As we
can only add material to the shape of the human leg and not subtract
anything, this seems to be an understandable trait from a design and
construction point of view. But from a biomechanical standpoint,
aren't plantigrade legs designed for bipedial motion? While digigrade
legs evolved for quadrapedial movement? Perhaps this is why adapting a
digigrade "look" to a bipedal costume usually looks akward to me. And
if the leg is at least in proportion to it's self, the occupant of the
'suit is walking *very* carefully. Mainly because there is no long-ish
platform upon which to balance the upright body in the fore and aft
directions.

Interestingly, I was practically laughed at recently for asking the
above question.

I've commissioned 'suits and had the option of including digigrade
legs on the body. But I've always opted out of this feature because I
never felt it looked all that convincing. Kind of like most sub
woofers in an audio system. More of something isn't always better. And
if it isn't convincing, I don't want it at all.

But since I like challenges and I like to buck the status quo, I've
been searching for a convincing digigrade leg design to incorporate
into a 'suit. So far, I like this from the front view:

http://www.saberfire.com/singlespeedcat/v/album26/costumes/makers/top2.jpg.html

It might be other proportions that make this look promising to me. I
haven't the experience to sort out which is what. At least not yet:)
My search continues.

What do you think about digigrade legs in a 'suit? Have you seen any
particularly nice examples? Please tell me about them.

And now back to our regular programming...

Hi Speedy

I had the same issue when making Marcwolf.  I have always seen him as
digitigrade and for a long time cound not find any nice way to do the
digitgrade stance.

After several movies - in particular Underworld and Underworld Evolutions
came out there is a decent design for digitigrade extenstion and the actors
who have used them say that the movements are very natural. Look at the
second movie as they progressed a lot with the extensions there.

Of interest - protheses designed for atheletes who have lost their lower
legs DO look digitgrade with the carbon fibre foot extension.

Now there are somne issues with a digitgrade stance - balance is one of them
but Stilt Walkers seem to get around Ok. The other is the dimensions between
leg and body.  If you look at the image on that link you will see that the
body/legs proportions are right, if the legs were say an extra 6 inches
longer then it would look too leggy.

When I finaly made Marcwolf I used the faux-digitgrade by faking it with
padding to give an optical illusion of a longer foot. On my site
http://marcwolf.org under the construction you will see 2 versions of the
legs. The first just being foam padding and the second a more detail version
that gives a very good look. Its more 'bulky' than what you might be looking
for but you can adjust the designs etc.  I got the inspiration from Marrok
:>

Creating the illlusion of a smaller foot is fairly easy by padding out the
front of the leg so that the viewer see's less of the instep. And then
making a longer line between the 'hocks' or back of the ankle to the top of
the knee will give you the psuedo calves. So in the end you have a visual
zig-zag effect for the viewer's eye to follow.

Moving is another part - I have created a cantalever between the hock and
the knee so that when I angle my own foot back - this section moves and
simulates the foot lifting and the hock moving up. I am often asked by
people if I get tired of standing on my toes in the costume - when I am
actually walking and moving plantigrade.

It also means that I am very agile and will get into football games and
other fun activities <laughs>

Anyway - have a look and if you have any Q's drop me a line.

Take Care

Marcwolf

Hey Spots. I`ve noticed that ALL of Mahiro`s suits have beautiful
digitigrade legs. She seems to specialize in them.
Not sure if you`ve seen the other pics of Alza's suit. But here they are.

Those are a good false digitigrade.

Notice that the heels are wedged about 2" to give a smaller footprint and both the upper and lower legs are well padded.  If you look closely, you can follow the straight leg.

I LIKE the suit!

David,

Thanks very much for the detailed descriptions of your work. That's
something along the lines of what I envision. Perhaps somewhat lighter
in appearence though. Ever since I did a mascot job during a central
Arizona summer, I've insisted on minimal padding. This cuts down on
weight, heat and maintainence. It can compromise the appearence of the
costume. This is a trade off that I willingly make. I try to
compensate for this through performance.

The character this is going to be used for is a werewolf. So I'm going
to go with a design that is somewhat more human in shape then canine.
He's also quite shaggy. Many details seem to be obscured by the fur
for the most part.

I know I won't get it 'right' this first time. But I can try. Right?

I'll take a look at the movies that you suggest. I do recall there
being alot of movement with the characters. And they did seem to get
around well. I do think that stilt walkers are pretty careful about
how they move. And that is reflected in their appearence.

I can't even imagine playing football out of 'suit! I'm too small and
lightweight for that:)

Cheers,

Single Speedy

Who's doing the commissions?

How much are we talking?

What kinda technologies on the suit? (movable jaw, digigrade, etc)

Any previous work to look at?

That's a good question.  What comes to mind quickly is ultrasuede.  I 
think it'd have the right visual texture, but I'm not sure it's quite 
right for this use.  Anyone out there touched a live Rhino and can comment?

Try being 5' 11" with 4" hoof heels and 12" high antlers on your dear
fursuit head and try not to break your antlers on every G~d D~~n door way
you walk through. Not to mention every other inanimate object trying to
brake them.

 Hey all, my name is Anil Zev in Rock Hill S.C and I'm a new

Atlanta, Georgia next year and was wondering if anyone else 
plan to go to the event as well? Would love to make some fur 
friends.

HEy everyone! I was just browsing around on the internet, and I found a really cool site for papier mache and fursuits, along with some other stuff. It's got a great tutorial for fursuit bodies, so I thought it was worthwhile to post it up.

  Hi all!

I'm performing live at an amateur singing contest in my home town of
Southampton, and I'm singing "Hungry like the Wolf" by Duran Duran. I plan
to impress the judges by ripping open my shirt during the bridge and
revealing a huge wolf decal on an undershirt. However, I'd also like to howl
convincingly. Can anyone who suits or role-plays as a wolf perhaps give me
some help on how to perfect a wolf howl?

Thanks, Hedgie

I sometimes see fursuit LiveJournal folks posting that they
need a specific fur, or have fur to trade.
What other ways are fursuiters trading new/unused fur?

Hmmm, Autumn vixen.

Not to be confused with Autumn Fox's  Summer Vixen fursuit. ^_^

http://fur-suit.org/?c=viewsuit&id=27

Neat database! I wonder if I could get listed on it? ^_^

You can do that by yourself.
Just create a profile, register and add your fursuits (and of course 
pictures of them!)

I`d suggest talking to Lionel about that. After all, he DID create the mask.

The http://fur-suit.org/ is a new one to me.  
I also just found out about http://www.fursuiter.org/ last week.
That means that there are 2 fursuit databases.
I think that's enough for us; they are both very nice to have for 
reference.

to Aerofox or anyone else, ;)
 yep, you just have to create an account on it, then login with it to add
your fursuit(s) and photos :)

As for who did / does what:
Growl got the original first site idea
Radjin maintained the old static version and gave me the static html
of the current look to work from.
And I made all the code and the rest happen ;)

For registering you don't even have to ask us ,
but if you have suggestions or technical questions  you can send
to me or onto the LJ:
http://community.livejournal.com/fur_suits/

Yeah I have one on there its free and really cool. All you have to do is sign 
up then go to control panel and work on you profile or fursuit files 
ex:fursuiter.org - fursuit database - user profile - Omen Nightfire See its just like 
that but your profile image has to be 250 pixels, but the gallery for the 
fursuit pics can be as big as you like.

Hey all.

Has there ever been a recorded version of the FC2002 FVS available? On the highlights tape, it was missing (albeit for a few tiny bits). Does anyone know if a recorded version exists at all?

Thanks, Hedgie.

Fursuiter may be nice, but fur-suit has already passed up the amount of
suiters Fursuiter had in half the time. Not saying anything bad about it,
just that fur-suit is faring much better.

Message-ID: <359ddd0e0610100635u3281bf9ck122ac7664275f949@mail.gmail.com>

Since we're on the subject of the fursuit databases, I'm looking at
having t-shirts made for fursuiter.org. I've done this previously for
a local furry group and it was way cool! ^^

Since I'm not much of an artist, I need some help with the design. It
should be simple line art ( something reproducible on white shirts
with black ink or black shirts with white ink ) and fursuit-themed.

There's a $250 ( US Dollars ) prize ( along with 5% of future t-shirt
sale profits! ) to the winning design.

Submissions should be sent to fursuiter.org at gmail.com no later than
November 1st, 2006.

Is there such thing as a true digigrade with bipedal biomechanics?

That's a very good observation. Like a few things that work well, it's
apparently comprised fine details like the heel wedge as well as large
ones like the shape of the quadracept padding. The foot wedge also
changes the posture of the occupant. This affects the look of the
whole 'suit.

It's nice work. The more you look, the more you can see:)

I agree fully - if you want to give a convincing digitgrade walk, you have to set up your posture in a digitgrade postition - knees slightly bent, heels raised, weight on your toes.  I think this is where a some performers fall short, and where the overuse of leg padding comes into play in trying to compensate for the difficulty in maintaining the right posture.  The reality is that padding doesn't do any good if the performer isn't willing to take on the right posture and walk in the right way.

My Santa Fox fursuit character is digitgrade, and if you look at him (http://santa-fox.livejournal.com/56508.html), you can see that the padding on his legs is not extremely noticable - especially in those pictures.  I added just enough to get the faux-digitgrade look, and could probably even use a little more on the lower legs.  But, rather than overpad for effect, I rely on my ability (a product of being small all my life) to walk for hours and hours on my toes in that faux-digitgrade stance to make the character's gait convincing.

I do like heal wedges BTW - they work wonders at reminding you to maintain the right stance, and even with my natural endurance I enjoy the comfort of being able to rest my weight on them at times without dropping down into a flat-footed plantigrade stance.  I'm working wedges into the new suit that I'm currently building and I can already see where they are going to be a big help.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

Absolutely. I see many 'suiters at cons believe that their costume
should do all the work for their character. It's a costume and you
wear it and *poof!* you're a puppy. Or some such critter. It seems
they don't put any more thought into the character then that. I keep
saying that the costume is just part of the story. Posture and
attitude is an important part too:)

Hi All

Or you could build an insert that will give you a digigrade stance like
this.

One is still plantigrade but the look is definately digigrade.  As I have
mentioned before the trick is to try and give the movement of the calf (the
line beteen the knee and the ankle and remember we are talking digigrade)
some realism.

I have managed to do that because the knee does bend allowing the calf and
the ankle position to swing up rather than just bending and stressing.

http://www.marcwolf.org/construct/Legs_web_2/img_17.html

http://www.marcwolf.org/construct/Legs_web_2/thumbs_3.html

Enjoy and feel free to use any idea's.

Marcwolf

what are you talking about...? fur-suit has 133 suits (though i dont think thats right based on 131 members that means everyoen registered 1 suit except 2 people somthigns wrong) while fursuiter has 339 registered suits... and ofcourse the "new one" that just went live and got advertized is goign to grow fast, all the peopel already registered at one would start to reg at the other.

fur-suit still has to almsot tripple in size to pass fursuiter.... i'd ahrdly say fur-suit is "farring better"

And it's not a contest (though i question the morals of registering the .com version to direct to the opiset database, thats just lame) 

In fact i think BOTH databases need to link to the other as a courtosy, in fact it woudl be nice if there was a shared creation page but thats unlikely to happen as the fields are so difernt.  But one can dream.

:p looks like i`m wrong. Maybe I should check my sources furst ne?

Aw well, I like them both. I`m on both, even though I dun have a suit. So I
would be one of those 2 people on fur-suit that hasn`t registered one yet.
So nothing is wrong. :D
I WILL have a suit, just that I wanted to get on the site and get my profile
and such up early. I`ll be able to add my suit in a year though I hope.

well we're not here to debate who's best or not ;)

Kaffa has assured me that the domain registration was a mistake of "dns
update" on his side, so there's hope that it'll not end up in too much
drama , and maybe the 'created in 2002' bug will vanish too :)

Well anyway, as it was said before, there's not need to get nasty about
one or the other, it's not a competition,
and our goal is to give something useful to the users.

The DBs  both have their differences and all, and suiters should just
register to both :)
It's a bit more work for sure, but it should be benefits to the end users
:)


As for linking, I still have to create the link page on the fursuit db,
but I do suggest both DBs on the fursuit archive for example.
http://fursuit.timduru.org and sub pages now.


About a common creation page, yeah that could have been nice, but as you
said it's a bit too late, as the datas are quite different under.

I am thinking of hosting a fursuit dinner gathering at Furfright on Friday 
night.

Plan is to meet sometime around 5-6 and the carpool to a local restaurant or 
hop the express bus to downtown Hartford where we can check out some nice 
local haunts like Blackeyed Sally's.

If anyone is interested please pop me a line via private email or LJ 
comment.  I would like to get an idea of the number attending by Sunday 
Night


More specific details to follow next week

Hmmm, I see now that it may have sounded like I was against one or the
other, but i`m not. I`m just bad when I comes to knowing the facts and such.
I like them both as I am registered on both. :D

Message-ID: <20061013011903.39996.qmail@web52512.mail.yahoo.com>

  I have a couple materials - related questions I would like to ask:

I am considering trying to build a head using the ?Fun Foam? you can find in craft stores.  (I think this is polyethylene foam.)  However, I find that the foam has a fairly pungent odor.  Does anyone know what this odor is, is it toxic, and does the smell subside enough that it would be worth building a head?
      I know that the upholstery foam gradually changes from a white to a brownish yellow.  I have seen the foam degrade just by sitting in a dark closet, only exposed to the air.  Does anyone know approximately how long the foam lasts, or if there are ways to slow the decay down?  I wonder if adding a layer of fabric, like maybe some inexpensive cotton fabric, would work?

  Finally, I?m wondering what works well for the bottom of feet.  I have some fairly thick vinyl, but I?m not too sure how well that will work.   I?ve hear of using rubber, but not too sure where to find it.  I?m not looking for anything special on the feet, just something durable that won?t wear out too quickly.
    I have scanned the FAQ, but I couldn?t find the answers I was looking for.

Thanks

AVA foam, a closed cell foam, is used in helmets nowdays.  Not sure what 
fun foam is, but here is a site where it was used for making LOTR armor.

I'm currently seeking panelists to run fursuit related panels at Further Confusion for 2007. I'm hoping to have both building and performing panels, and have a few in mind, and am also seeking ideas for new panels. I currently need panelists to handle fursuiting building panels, from basic to advanced. I'm also hoping nayone with pro experience would be willing to run a panel about their experiences as a pro, showing what it's actually like from an experienced point of view. Performance panels are always welcome, I'm hoping to find some experienced fursuiters who would be willing to share their knowledge and experiences. If you're interested in running any panels, or have a panel idea, please contact me privately at tiresta at grics.net. Thanks!

I don't think U have to worry about fun foam being toxic. It is made for  
kids to do arts and crafts with.
I do not think you have to worry about upholstery foam decaying. Maybe in  
10-20 years!.
I have a sofa and it is not decaying, but the seats on my 1970 truck  are!
As for the bottoms of feet, I use interlocking floor mats designed for  
around your weightbench or tool box, etc. Avail. at Home Depot, Lowes,  etc.
Lightweight and easy to cut and it is made to be walked on!
 
Hope this helps,

For the bottom of the feet,I heard a piece of carpet works well. Seems to 
me,it would be a tough.long lasting material.

I'm also hoping nayone with pro experience would be willing to run a panel about their experiences as a pro, showing what it's actually like from an experienced point of view. Performance panels are always welcome, I'm hoping to find some experienced fursuiters who would be willing to share their knowledge and experiences. If you're interested in running any panels, or have a panel idea, please contact me privately at tiresta at grics.net. Thanks!

Is there any convincing way to get a new fur on top of an older fur for part of a suit.  There are some thing you just can't bring yourself to using a hot glue gun.  Are there any sewing techniques or anything that would make this possible?

Hot glue makes things stiff... A couple things to do;

You could shave the fur down where you want to put the fur patch or leave 
it as it is for a somewhat 'bubbled' or raised look depending on how much 
life or pile is left of the original fur.

Then either sew it normally, making sure the threads aren't easily seen (I 
forget the name of the stitching methods you want to use) or use a kind of 
flexible adhesive like GOOP.

The cat in the hat suit that was worn in the videos that were send out a
while back as well as the one I wore for Barnes and Noble has a fur over fur
pattern to make the sketcky looking fur of the book come to life. On the
inside of the suit it looks like the stitch used was a machine stitch
zig-zag. Then the fur was brushed up out of the seams. But the fur itself
was kinda a lumpy almost curly short pile, reather like a rex cat fur that
didn't look bad mussed and rumpled. I believe perhaps carefu handstitching
may work to.

Ok, looking for discussion on this.  When the first Fursuit parade was started at 
AAC97, it was done as a way to allow the dealers who are couped up all day in the 
dealer's room and oportunity to photo and see the fursuiters they miss out on seeing 
roaming the hallways and such.  Most conventions that have started doing parades 
also followed suit, finding ways to route parades through dealer's rooms and artists 
allies.  It is a challenge sometimes, and does take a lil initiative on the part of 
con security to make things work, but the parades are usually a big enough venue to 
make such things happen.

I have learned that MFF, in it's executive descision, has decided to ban the parade 
from going into these artist's areas.  I have gotten no clear reason as to why, 
other than a "The Dealer's room lead says no, and the programming staff says it's 
final."

Well this sure defeats the initial intent of the first parades 10 years ago.  I as a 
fursuit performer and those that build suits like to show them off, and there is a 
large audience of dealer's that would probably like to see these works.  Every time 
I've been in a dealer's room, there are many dealer's with their cameras shooting 
photos along the path.  

I would hate to thing the con is catering to one person who said they didn't want 
the parade in the dealer's den, when I'm sure there are many more dealer's that wish 
to see it.

To me, if the dealer's den is avoided for the parade, it makes it not worth my time 
or effort.  I'm already roaming the halls and lobby in fursuit, and thus the regular 
attendance is already getting to see the fursuits and take photos..  and are able to 
take better photos than the time a parade quick shot would allow.

Curious to know, how many other people find that it would be a waste of effort to do 
a hall walk parade, and skip the 100 or so dealer's?

I for one, will not be in MFF's parade.

I'm not a dealer but have participated in many parades, thought 
they were a lot of fun and judging by all the people with cameras 
waiting along the path it seems to be a popular event.. 

I'm curious as to why the MFF staff made such a decision, seems 
kind of silly to me..

A part of me is thinking it might be due to one or two dealers who would  
rather have people shop at their stalls than gawk at the fursuiters. I'm in the  
building process of my first fursuit that, when finished, will debut at  
Anthrocon 2007. I currently can afford two fur cons a year, specifically AC and  
MFM. If I can get things in order financially, I'd love to attend the one  
October con as well.

Even as a staff member at MFF, I'm wondering it
myself.  Myself and Ocicat (who is the fursuit track
head at MFF) took this to a staff meeting recently and
we asked if we could get the parade to go back through
the dealer's den this year and we were given a no by
the Dealer's Den director himself...even after Ocicat
recieved numerous complaints about not going in the
Dealer's Den.

That's all I can say about it.  We're trying to
convince him to let the route to go back through the
Dealer's Den, but it doesn't look like it's going to
happen this year. :/

I'd probably parade anyway ass i dotn do ti for the dealer, i do it to be seen with the other suiters and still a lto fo peopel line up for the parade and get the biggest colelction of suits all in one go, also whiel you dotn get good stills in a parade I like to be in the videos.

Now if the dealers want to stage a boycot or somthing i might help.  Personally if the dealers want to see a fursuit parade they need to fight / complaign with the con staff about it, or ave all the dealer s walk out of the dealer room at that point to watch the parade (it doesn't take long )  As a suiter i'm not that worried if the dealers see me or not But if they want to see the parade I'm all for suppoting a patition or boycot to support the cause.

My desicion to participate in the parade is more so determiend by when it is held

I seem to be the only one who remembers this for some reason, but I was there 
so I ought to know....

That first Fursuit parade way back at AAC97 really started out more as a 
"spontaneous accident" when no audience showed up for the scheduled fursuit 
"Petting Zoo" meet & greet in the hotel ballroom.  So we decided on the spur of the 
moment not to waste the convention timeslot and march out from the ballroom 
and go all around the convention space and public areas of the hotel.  It was 
not "done as a way to allow the dealers etc.", it was just done, period.  
Regardless, it went well...so every year and con since, it was done, again and again 
etc.

It was spontanious, but when it was found that people who wanted to  
see the petting zoo could not get out of the dealer's room, that's  
when we took it to them..  I made noise and guided the group out of  
the dealer's room clanging cymbal..

Unfortunately, I'm not going to MFF this year due to lack of funds.

However, I think as always when suiting one needs to remember two  
things:
1. Is everyone around me having fun.
At a distant second:
2. Am I having fun?

Really, the only thing that matters is are you entertaining or  
disappointing?  If you're not entertaining people, need to change or  
not do whatever.  If you're entertaining as many people as you  
can....then keep it up.

While it's been a nice gesture to offer folks in the Dealer's Room and 
Artist's Alley a view of the many fursuits on display over the weekend, the 
Fursuit Parades also offers the best opportunity for con attendees to video 
or take still pictures of the miriad of costumed critters out at the con.

IMO while the aisles in the Dealer's Den at MFF are adaquate for trapsing 
around in costume, the aisles at MFF's new, larger, Artist's Alley were 
significantly less so.

At the risk of sounding likea whiny bitch, I'd rather suit a shorter parade 
and have the stamina to be in suit longer after the parade to pose for 
stills or group shots.  Or even have the endurance left to take part in the 
Fursuit Games, if they're being held on Sunday.  By Sunday, late morning, I 
know I'm sporting a hefty load of sleep deprivation, probably haven't eaten 
as well as I should be, and have probably been in suit for 12-18 hours 
already over Friday and Saturday.

So if the Fursuit Parade needs to evolving into something new to accomodate 
the changing needs, larger spaces, and revised lay-outs of today's Furry 
Conventions then it should not resist that change.  It still serves as an 
important and popular weekend attraction that draws the same, if not more, 
attention as Two's Rant, Kage's Story Hour or the Masquarades and Variety 
Shows.  If that means that Artist's Alley and the Dealer's Rooms are "out of 
the loop" (Pun intended), then I'll make time to wander to those spaces 
during the weekend on my own so they don't miss out.

That's my take on this issue.

You can also use a big-flip-flop with the thong cut off of it as the
bottom of a foot. It's very durable, though not 100% natural looking,
giving the bottom of the foot the look of a shoe, not a paw with toes.

I've heard of fun-foam being used as an accent on the head, but I
don't know about making it with fun-foam. Are you sure this is the
craft-store foam that comes in thin sheets, and is used for kids to
play with? I've never gotten any fun-foam that had a bad smell to
it... The smell might come from something that it was stored with, but
it might be dangerous if it's a different sort of foam. Also, I think
making a head with this kind of foam might be very warm.

If you're at a loss for foam, though,  you can get a foam similar to
upholstery foam (not as durable, slightly different, but fine for
making mesh-and-foam heads with, probably okay for balaclava-styled
too) in 2-inch strips at the hardware store, to use for sealing
windows with air conditioners. It's called 'Air Conditioner
Weatherseal" and it's grey, and squishy. About $3 a packet, a packet
is enough to make a small mesh head.

If the foam in the head degrades, by the time it's not worth it
anymore the head will be old and probably falling apart from use
anyway.

Saturday evening is when the fursuit games and the
dance is going on at MFF so it would be hard to work
around without reshuffling events around and I'm sure
some of our fellow dancing fursuiters don't want to
march a parade in any sort of length and then go
attend the dance.  Saturday evening is also
traditionally when our "Fursuit Games" are held as
well so that evening is usually jam packed with
fursuit activities anyway.

Plus, the Dealer's Den is going to close at a bit of a
later time this year as well at MFF so the parade
would have to be around 8-9pm if we did go that route
and most of the scheduled main events have already got
their time slots settled.  Plus, you have the post
parade photoshoot which would have to be in the
ballroom (which it would be rude to interupt the dance
just so we can get all the suiters in the ballroom for
the photo) and if we do take the route outside, I'm
sure we would like some daylight to see while out
there. ;)

Many dealers are fursuiters themselves anyway.  Only
issue you will have is peopel with early sunday
checkout if you do it after ti clsoes sunday
so do it saterday evenign after dealers den is locked
up.  dealers can see parade, dealers can aprticipate

Subject: FL: MFF  fursuit parade


This is the second year going forward that we have not
been allowed to enter the dealer's den as part of the
MFF fursuit parade. Now, while a fursuiter, and track
lead, Im just as broken up and mystified at this
situation as the rest of you are. As track lead
believe me, I only want the best for my attendees, and
to ensure they have a good time, and stay safe in the
process. Many things were factored into the decison
NOT to go into the dealer's den last year, namely the
issue of stairs leading to the con space, a real
obstacle for many suiters to negotiate to geing with.
While many suiters can make the stairs with not
difficulty, there are a good many that simply cannot.
Since we don't have elevators that reach the bottom
floor at the MFF hotel, there is no safe way of
getting everyfur down to that area.

This year remains much the same as last year at this
point in time. The parade route(s) were discussed, and
entry into the dealer's den, art show and artist alley
were again addressed at the last staff meet. Simply
put, dealers den does not want fursuiters trapsing
through that area. Im sure there are logical reasons
why. I would love to give everyone the answer, but I
simply don't have it right now. The issue will be re
addressed at the next staff meeting in October.

 

Rest assured there are solutions to this problem, and
I encourage everfur to calm down, relax, have some
dip, and wait. We're working on the problem, and will
do our best to satisfy everyone. Keep in mind
'everyone' includes suiters and non suiters alike. If
the dealers choose not to allow us to enter their
space, or don't want us there, that is their decision.
I know a number of dealers complained that they missed
the parade last year, believing the parade would wind
down to their con space. I know certainly since MFF's
inception the parade's route has included the dealers
den. The parade route is tradion, it's a part of the
con, it lets the hard working dealers see and be
entertained by the fursuits, I know how important of a
social event the parade is, and how well attended it
is. To deny any of our hard working dealers a chance
to see the parade isn't fair, but if that's the way
they want it- so be it.

Im doing all I can for you my fellow suiters- we will
find an answer...

Update!!

On Friday 10/20 I will be hosting a dinner for all those who enjoy the art 
of Fursuiting at Furfright.

We will be meeting in the lobby near the hotel desk at 5pm and from there we 
will carpool/bus/shuttle/ or walk to a restaurant.

The exact restaraunt will be determined sometime later in the week (depends 
on the size of the group)

Just to clarify,  this is NOT and "in suit" dinner gathering.  It is a 
dinner open to anyone that is a fursuiter.

If you are planning on attending please RVSP to me no later than Wednesday 
afternoon.

I will be calling up restaurants on Wednesday night if we have a large count 
by then.  If not we will determine our eatery on Friday.

Message-ID: <8C8BFC4E52399A3-880-3AFE@WEBMAIL-RA21.sysops.aol.com>

 Hey all,
 I'm working on a raptor partial-suit, and have ran into some difficulty with the 4ft tail. As some may know, a raptors tail sticks straight out, and that makes it kinda hard to simulate. The obvious solution is some sort of butt brace that is durable enough to support it. Its made of foam, so its not *that* heavy, but balancing it so it doesn't drag the ground is another matter. I've never used a butt-plate before. Is that something you can buy at a sports store? Any recommendations for possibly making one myself cheaply? Also, would it need shoulder straps like a harness to help keep it up too? Any info is greatly appreciated!
 
 Thanks,
 ~Jackie Randa

Butt-plates? can be found in the "Beyond" section of Bed Bath & Beyond.

Just kidding.

For Scabrous the dragon I made a tail armature and butt-plate from  
foamed PVC sheeting (available from Tap Plastics, though other  
decently-equipped plastics supply and signage shops may carry it).   
Just a few dollars' worth from the scrap bin.  The butt-plate portion  
was curved using a heat gun to better conform to the rounded  
posterior profile.

Unfortunately I didn't take many pictures of the construction  
process, but an internals-and-completed view can be seen here:

     http://members.dslextreme.com/users/pburgess/scab-tail- 
internals.jpg

The butt-plate can be seen in the left center area of the top photo.   
Note also (in the lower photo) the semi-rigid extension into the belt  
(heat-bent Delrin rod, another Tap item) which helps anchor the base  
of the tail.  Plate and rod are joined by heavy-gauge wire.

The "finished" photo doesn't show the shoulder straps which were  
added shortly thereafter.  Highly recommended, if for no other reason  
than as a fallback in case the waist belt should fail (happened once  
with another suit).

One thing you might consider is rather then simply a butt plate is to use a 
harness that would allow you to have an 'external spine' and spread any 
weight out over your shoulders and back.  Even with light tails I find that 
hanging them from a belt or across your hips can be uncomfortable and make 
them somewhat unstable.  A harness would keep the tail aligned more to your 
body as I believe a raptor's tail is suppose to be.  Inexpensive harnesses 
could be found at surplus store or at Big Lots and the such.

That's one place that I feel that I fall short in. I never think that I give
a good performance for my suits. My problem in trying to think of how to
act. I am a hoof and hoofed animals are not that animated. For the most part
there just walking to the next tuff of grass to eat. I have watched my horse
and donkey for hours. If I did not like just watching them, I would have
been put to sleep by there lack of doing anything.

I've been away from email since Friday, so I just got caught up on this thread.  As the fursuit track director at FWA now, I've been reading this thread with great interest, since we have a new hotel for FWA 2007 and I'm going to have to create a parade route through our new con space that's going to have to work well for everyone. (BTW, pre-reg now: you don't want to miss out on all the fun and excitement of the new-and-improved FWA 2007: www.furryweekend.com)

I personally have a number of mixed feelings on parades, and a short while ago, I wrote in my LJ about some of the things that bug me about cons, and one of the things I said was this:

> Fursuit parades and the group photo. I've lost a lot of interest in these at cons
> like MFM that have so many suiters now, because I feel like just one of the 
> crowd, and it's so hard to stick out and get noticed when you're marching in the > parade line or standing in a pose with fifty-plus other suiters. Especially when 
> you're small, like me.

I think one of the most important changes over the last ten years is that the number of fursuiters in the fandom has probably quadrupled.  I'd love to know the suiter headcount at AC97 - my educated guess would be under fifty.  I think this year there was what - over three hundred?  MFM's parade this year had about seventy suiters, I think, but in any case it was a pretty large group.  It's just a fact of life that the more suiters in a parade, the slower it will go and the more accessible the path has to be to ensure that everyone gets through safely.  On the other hand, at RCFM this year, we had maybe twenty suiters tops, so we could go pretty much anywhere, since we were in and out of rooms in just a few minutes.  

I can definitely understand the important issue of avoiding steps, and while I haven't seen the MFF hotel yet, I know that the steps into the MFM dealers den always pose a problem for some, and were a reason why the MFM parade did not go through their dealer's den this year.  I can only imagine the dificulties if all suiters had to go from one floor of a building to another up or down a narrow staircase.  I'm ususally pretty good with stairs, but even I tripped up several times in the stairwells at MFM last month.  Fortunately, the new FWA parade route is going to stay completely on the main convention floor of the new hotel and will not have any steps up or down anywhere, so I know that will in and of itself be a joy for many suiters.  

On the main subject of this thread - dealers dens - I have to admit that one of the downsides to parading through dealers dens is that I feel like I have to be very contained in my antics for fear of knocking over something valuable.  On parades in some dens, I've felt like I had to just shuffle my way through, giving no more than a wave and an occasional bounce forward.  To me, that's no fun at all, and is why I make a point at every con I attend to wander through the dealers den in fursuit on my own at least two or three times during the con.  This way, I can take my time going through, can stop and pose for pictures wherever I want, and can actually spend time doing some shtick for those dealers who take more than a passing interest in me.  I would be far more irked if fursuiters were banned completely from a con's dealers den, than to just have parade access denied.

As of right now, plans are for the FWA fursuit parade to continue going through the dealers den, and hopefully the journey will be even easier than in past years.  I don't foresee any problems, but I'm still going to work with our dealer's den head to try to ensure that the room is laid out in a way that will allow the parade to pass through with the least amount of potential difficulty.

As for MFF, I plan to participate in the parade regardless of what happens - this may be my only time there for a good while, so I want to make the most of it.  I plan to visit the dealer's den on my own in suit if they'll let me, but if they won't, I'll certainly be irked but I'm not going to let that stop me from having a good time at the con.  I'll just have to find other ways to get my fursuiting kicks.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

Here is one of my pet complaints about fursuit parades:

Would someone please bring a jam box or something and play some music during 
the parade? I hate those silent death-march parades! I'd bring one myself, 
but I usually fly and there isn't room.  No big deal, but it makes the 
parade so much livelier.

when the parade is 200-300 suiters long? no you dont here the symbol in the 
back :)

I dont think music or noise is the answer as that will anoy many both at the 
hotel and other furs at the event.  trqversign stairs shouldn't really be a 
big deal if we're only taking a few stairs bring a peic eof plywood and make 
a mini ramp, if it's many stairs there is almost always a ramp already, an 
elevator or escalator , or worst case so the few suiters who can't manage 
stais dont participate or dont carticipate in that part of the route.    Yes 
the parade are somewhat boring but they serve a purpose.  I thionk cons need 
to contineu ot have parades just like they need to continue to have opening 
ceramonies no matter hwo poorly attended.

What con was it that si havign 2 parades a day and an evening? was that mff 
or fwa?
or fc? soem con soon or recently i read was ahvign 2

Draconis came up with the idea of a "Midnight Prowl Parade" for RCFM this year.  Being the GPOH there, I led that one off as Rantula the Tarantula, and I liked it the concept so much that I borrowed the idea for my planning for FWA 2007.  In the meantime, I decided at the last moment to organize an unofficial midnight parade at MFM this year.  I might try to do the same thing at MFF if they don't do one of their own accord.

Don't know whether any other cons do a second parade.  I personally think the midnight parade is a good change of pace and, of course, it gives suiters the chance to parade in a different costume if they own multiple suits.  I also like the idea of keeping them simple, staying mostly to the hallways, lobbys and other open spaces, and letting it end at the nightly dance rather than in a group photo somewhere.  

Cheers,
Santa Fox

Silly as it may seem, I'm actually not sure what to do during a
parade. Wave at people and keep moving or slow down and pose for pics.
I usually opt for the former because the latter jams up the flow of
traffic and makes an already long parade even longer. Mebbe more
people should shoot videos!

As for noise during a parade, I say the more the better. Within reason
of course. I agree with Chaka that a silent parade doesn't look very
appealing. How does that sound? *chuckles*

What's the big deal about skipping the dealer's den? Suiters are not
wanted there. So what? A short parade is okay!

I have never attended nor heard of a con that featured two parades.

Think of the stair case at MFM and multiply it by
about 10 times.  It's a pretty long staircase to get
down to where the dealer's den and registration is at.
 And, other than the parade, fursuiters are ok in the
dealer's den at MFF.

At our yearly "Procession of the Species" in Olympia, Washington
we feature a lot of simple percussion throughout the parade. It
ads magic to our movements and creates excitement. A small
group with hand drums and shake gourds here and there does
the trick. Or treat.

Roar.

Hmm... Now I'm a bit curious about it. Does the number of fursuiters has 
grown only because the number of furries in general grew, or does the 
proportion of Fursuiters to non-fusuiters got bigger in the last ten years?

usually, with exception to a few cons  most cons fursuit about 10% of  
total attendee  so like ac = 2000 attendee, parade sees 200.

megaplex turned 50 suits out for 200 attendees, so it had a bit  
higher ratio, but as general rule, 10% seems to fit most cons.

I feel that the proportion of suiters to non-suiters have changed.

I've been going to fur cons since 1997 and didn't have a fursuit  
untill 2000.
Many other furs I know who have been going to cons as long ago are now
getting or have fursuits where they didn't years back.

I knew I wanted one back then, I just didn't have the means or help  
to get
furred up ^_^

not really, when AC was at 500 attendees, parade was like 50.  the  
year we had 1100 attendees, we broke 100, this year, 2000 broke 200.   
same kinda holds true at FC, tho it started off slower for some reason.

We need someone with a good bass drum and to step off with the right .... okay maybe not that organized.

But maybe the last fursuit could go with a boom box and the start go with the cymbal.

I may be wrong but I believe FurFright was planning
multiple fursuiter type events, possibly a second
parade.

The number of fursuits probably has increased due to
income matching interest.  I knew before I even got
into furry that I wanted a mascot type outfit, never
considered that it could be made for me privately
until after I found out about the fandom.  Then of
course it takes time and money to actually acquire
one.  You generally don't come into the fandom with
your own suit :P
Plus, I think it has to be noted that those who own
multiple suits seem to be increasingly allowing
friends and mates to wear one of them and join in on
the fun.

Has there ever been a comparison of number of
fursuiters versus total convention headcount for each
con?  AC has the most membership and fursuiters
overall but I'm betting ratio wise the medium cons
have the largest percentage of suiters.


One thing I'm curious about (if it hasn't been
discussed already), anybody have any feelings about
parade length?  The parade at MFF last year was oh so
short after excluding the dealer's room; on the
flipside, the parade at this past AC was pretty damn
long thanks to the new location.
Personally, I prefer the longer parades - you gotta
get used to the sweating if you're in suit, and it's
hard to get enough of seeing so many together. 
Though, I could do with fewer stops and maybe if
something could be done to make it more entertaining
than just a long line of fursuits.  Gotta also spread
out the more active suiters, otherwise some seem to
get lost in the crowd.

The multiple stops along AC's parade route were to allow photo ops   
(The stop above the dealer's room, and then off the balcony)

there is no rule that one can't do their own antics along the parade  
route, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone, or slow down the procession.

also the stops help those that get winded catch their  breath a lil.   
yes AC was a marathon route, but, even after the exhaustion, I felt  
great afterwards..  At least it was indoor..  try doing that same  
length parade, outside, in FL heat when it's 98 degrees, in the magic  
kingdom, every day a 3pm...  and having to maintain a high energy  
level performance as you go..    comparitevly, the AC parade was a  
cake walk.     Now I know for many new suiters, it was dificult, but  
practice will bring up endurance.

Why so many suits now?  I think it's easier to buy, or make your own suit
due to finding information on the Internet.  There are a lot of websites,
and Communities that help people find or build, their perfect costume.

About the parade: Let's do it anyway.  If people in the Den don't want us,
so be us, we can walk outside of it and they can come out if they wanna
oogle us!!

Hmm... Now I'm a bit curious about it. Does the number of fursuiters has
grown only because the number of furries in general grew, or does the
proportion of Fursuiters to non-fusuiters got bigger in the last ten years?

I did get a few chances to wear fursuits before I had my own ^_^

You'll be able to find them on <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/> - that
is when we post the schedule.

We hope to publish a small portion of our (tentative) schedule online in
the next couple of weeks, so keep your eye on the site.

Actually, we had a boom box at EF. The fursuiter who led the parade had a
boom box that played silly dance music (vengaboys and the like). People
really seemed to like it, even the non-furry folks who were there outside of
the con site seemed to like all those "strange mascot things" dancing around
to that silly music.

I'd give it a shot.

For my long tails I use a "butt plate" made from the top (or bottom)of a  
plastic 55 gallon drum (Or a trash can would work) With some padding so as not  
to dig into my spine and the whole thing just attaches with a belt around my  
waist.

So far I've only made rabbit and horse tails.  The base plate I use
for those is the top of the lid for a spindle of CDROMs or DVDROMs,
with slats cut into it to allow the nylon cording through.

Yep, the music definitely was a nice addon,
as you say , even the tourists around were enjoying it seeing all the
suiters moving to it :)
As for the cymbals and other squeeky and noisy things, it might be
interesting to get multiple boxes, as people in the back of the parade
couldn't hear anything. :)

And if you go for a sound system, better not choose a cd player like mine
;)
it was skipping badly with every little shock at EF ;)
Maybe go for some tape or mp3 memory card stereo player or something :)

for the butt plate try making it out of the same foam as your head.. we use 
a closed cell foam and it is lighter, more comfortable and easier to wear.

ConiFur is no more until further notice, at least at this time.  I believe 
there really is no staff to keep it going for a number of reasons why.  For 
sure there is no ConiFur this year and quite likely no ConiFur next year.

And so to answer your question, no website for a con that is no more.

Ya. :P

Of course, having their hotel demolished really puts a crimp in your
style.  AC was big enough to move to a convention center, for better or
worse.  ConiFur just couldn't make it.

However, good to know about the others there. :)

Subject: FL: Undersuits
Message-ID: <20061020022201.60182.qmail@web52508.mail.yahoo.com>

  I was looking through the FAQ, and found Sardog?s opinion on using a unitard as an undersuit.  My first question is about material.  In the FAQ, Sardog recommends cotton.  I do know that Cotton is an absorbent matieral.  Nylon and Polyester are not as absorbent.  (Nylon is what Under Armour uses for Heat Gear shorts, and polyester for Heat Gear shirts.  I haven?t been able to figure out why they use different materials for the shirt and shorts.  Nor have I seen a polyester unitard anyway).  Is the absorptive property of cotton something useful in the mascot/fursuit environment?
    Secondly, I was wondering if anyone had any experiences or opinions of a unitard that has fingers and or a hood?
   Thanks

Hey;

I think the main reason for cotton, and, the absorbant nature of cotton is that it would retain the sweat your body gives off, as opposed to an underarmour type thing where the whole purpose is to transmit the sweat away from your body.

So, why do we want it retain?  Well, one of the main reasons for wearing the suit is to aid in keeping the suits clean.  So... You sweat, it transfers to the cotton undersuit, you wash the undersuit.  

Also, at the time that I wrote that, I don't believe that underarmor was a significant player in the market, if they existed at all.  I can say that we are currently evaluating the use of UA and it's alternatives, as an option for undersuits.

I would avoid the use of a suit with built in hands.  Your hands seem to be a major cooling point. Plus, it could affect your dexterity for doing up zippers, etc.

As for the hoods..  I can only recommend them, although most of our people don't wear them.  (Yet complain bitterly when the long hair gets in their eyes) If nothing else, it helps stabilize their hair.  However, again, creates an effective barrier between their body and the suit.

S.

Wow! A lot of those have such big heads. I find it funny that the one 
that looks like it's based off of Pickachu is named "Spanky"!

A special point of interest is that the last suit pictured on this 
page: http://tails03.hp.infoseek.co.jp/page019.html
...is a Latinvixen creation:

I wonder if the suit was sold. It says Lucas on LVs site, but on the
Japanese site, it`s saying the name is Julian. Then again, it DOES say it`s
an American puppy. So maybe the suiter just has two names.

I can't see where it says American puppy since it reads only in Japanese text.

  I wonder if the suit was sold. It says Lucas on LVs site, but on the Japanese site, it`s saying the name is Julian. Then again, it DOES say it`s an American puppy. So maybe the suiter just has two names.

I think that LatinVixen (or the previous owner) auctioned off this 
suit, and this Japanese company was the winner.

Hey All;

I thought I'd update a note on this file...  

I spoke with the gear manufacturer for a similar brand to UnderArmour. Since they are already a sponsor of ours, I brought it up about using the UA for under the suits.

The conversation went something like this...

Me:. We'd like to issue UA to our mascots, to provide a barrier between our performers and the suits.

SR: These are your mascots??..

Me: Yes, we're finding our performers wearing various degrees of clothing under the suits, from the bear minimums, ie. underwear, to gym shorts etc.

SR: So, you want to use UA to isolate...

Me: Yes.

SR: Don't recommend it... UA is designed to transfer sweat away from an athletes (or performers body) to the next level of clothing  In this case, you'd be transfering the sweat from the performers, to the suits..  I'd recommend a cotton or similar material that will absorb the sweat, so that when they change, the bulk of the nastiness goes with the performer.

This would be a good time for Furtech to chime in with his opinon.

S.

Hello everyone, I have had experience with Under Armor in another lining of costuming in a club called the 501st Legion.  A Star Wars costuming club.  I can say that normally after a "troop" or costumed event, everyone who was wearing UA (Under Armor) finds a pool of sweat in their Stormtrooper costumes, collecting in the plastic armor.  

Maybe another option could be silk?  I know that skiers wear long silk underwear under their ski suits to help wisk after sweat while they are sking.  Has anyone tried that route yet in a fursuit?

A lot of the professional suit-performers (mascot, creature fx, etc.) 
have a routine they do that starts at least a day before they're going 
to be in costume.  This involved lots of hydrating (water, diluted 
gatorade, etc.)  and not taking long, hot showers (starting at least a 
day before).  Just take quick (like, 3 minute) cold showers.  If you 
take a hot shower (or soak in a bath or jacuzzi) on the day you're going 
to be in-costume, you will sweat like a pig.  Your skin can absorb (and 
then discharge) a LOT of water.

The type of undergarment will depend on the costume: with a 
loose-fitting mascot-style costume (with lots of air gaps) a nylon 
spandex unitard is best, since there is air for the moisture to 
evaporate away to.  As you move, this air is circulated in and out (you 
will often feel cooler walking easily than standing stock-still). 

For tight-fitting suits that do not breathe well (like many muscle-suits 
and Storm Trooper suits), cotton spandex is best.  You'll have to change 
it out more often (probably hourly), so bring a lot of extras because 
they'll get soaked.  I know some people who use those headbands that you 
soak in water in the summer and wear to keep cool, only they use them in 
reverse: they wear them dry and let them absorbe the water.  If you're 
REALLY desperate to not soak your suit, you can actually use disposeable 
diapers (or anything that will absorb water and store it)-- but I've 
never been that frantic.

There are exceptions: if you have an open-face costume or headless (like 
a "Cats" type costume), use nylon unitards.  Full head costumes create 
an enormous amount of heat and moisture build-up.  Without the head on, 
I can wear a full muscle suit covered in fur all day and only feel warm; 
put the head on and I'm starting to feel it in less than an hour.

Also, if there -is- air circulation use nylon spandex.  Inflateable 
costumes, costumes made with NFT fur and/or reticulated foam 
(open-celled foam) breathe enough to wick away the moisture faster than 
it can build up. 

I've not yet used the Under Armour line yet, so I'm not sure how 
effective it is (or not).  I use standard Baltog nylon or cotton spandex 
unitards for just about everything.  Even though nylon does send the 
moisture through, any covering will help to prevent the nasty elements 
of sweat from mucking up your costume.  I also thoroughly douse the 
costume (often turning it inside-out) with Endbac II.  Sometimes a 
quarter of a can on one costume and head.  The stink is from bacteria in 
your sweat and on your skin: if you destroy the bacteria, the costume 
won't stink.  My partner-in-crime learned this when she was doing 
maintenance on the Ripper costumes in "Tank Girl": they were shooting in 
a copper mine in Tuscon in high summer (110+ temps) all day.  When they 
missed -one- costume-- boy did they know it!  Whew!

Speaking of hygene, being well-scrubbed and not stinky -before- getting 
into your costume will go a long way to keeping it clean and 
stink-free.  As I said above, though: the day you're going to wear the 
costume (and the day before if you want to sweat even less), take quick 
cold showers (turn the water off during soaping) and you'll be clean and 
won't stink up your suit!

Subject: FL: Opinions..  Fursuit Parades.
In-Reply-To: <20061015212035.GA7065@foxpup.forest.thefoxden.com>
Message-ID: <20061022052651.49128.qmail@web52010.mail.yahoo.com>

Here is some snippits of a message I was forwarded
from the MFF Programming Director, Chouette, which
sheds some light on the reason behind why the Fursuit
Parade isn't allowed in the Dealer's Den.  And even I
overlooked this fact myself...

Wildfox
MFF Constructed Fuzziness - Puppet Track
MFF FVS 2nd

"However, The Dealers Room does NOT want the whole
parade going through -- yes, (a) too many people, (2) 
too narrow aisles (they are packed to the gills to fit
in as many dealers as they can in the same
un-expanded-size room as last year), and (3) the
dealers did complain in the past.   Look, Anthrocon
has an absolutely HUMONGOUS room for the Dealers, so
the parade can easily go through there and works out
just fine.  
BUT  ---  OUR room is miniscule by comparison -- and
is already WAY overcrowded with dealer tables   Hence,
the Dealer Room's refusal to allow it in the parade
route for as long as their room remains this small.  
(Maybe at newer, bigger hotel, it will be different.
Most likely.)"

"And Make the route LONGER, by all means!   Make it
last as long as you can!  
It NEEDS to be made into more of a "spotlight" special
event.  It has needed this for years, as far as I'm
concerned.
---- Go out around the side of the hotel and back in,
if you want.  
[The only objections I heard or even echoed myself,
was that (a) no sidewalks out there, just grass or
walking in the street -- and there's not much audience
out there? ]
-- but hey DO it if it helps make it more of a parade
for you all??  All OK with me.
I keep suggesting to maybe walk the whole parade route
TWICE, to make it last longer?  You could shift the
route slightly for appearance's sake on the 2nd lap,
but .. hey, whatever works to make it longer event and
more of a Real Parade."

"Like I said, I haven't been able to read the posts,
but I can imagine what they're upset about -- and I
bet I would agree with most of it."  

"But we do need to compromise by giving the Dealers
Room want they DON'T want -- which is 120+ suiters
squeezing through their narrow over-crowded room.  1
or 2 suiters can wend their way through and shop, yes,
that's not a problem.
-- but a huge line of them is just more than they can
deal with and I can understand that."

1.  Overflow Hotel Online Reservation System Up and Operational

The San Jose Doubletree is completely sold out at this point. However, we
have been able to obtain an overflow hotel for those of you who need the
rooms. Online registration is available as well as by telephone. The
Holiday Inn San Jose is within easy walking distance from the Doubletree
and has the amenities we want our attendees to have to make their stay
pleasant.

The price is $114 per night for up to 4 people, and rooms are available
for all convention days. Yes, this is more than the DoubleTree, but
extremely cheap for the Bay Area.

Please see the Further Confusion web site Hotel page for instructions on
how to reserve your room, and information on the Hotel Amenities, at the
link below.

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/hotel.php> 


2.  Badge Art Submission Deadline

Further Confusion is currently seeking artwork submissions for the 2007
membership badge inserts. Both color and black and white artwork will be
accepted, and all artwork will be considered on overall 'look and
feel', plus these additional points:

. Size: Art must scale to be printed at 4" x 2".
. Theme: Art must accurately reflect the theme of the con.
. Age appropriateness: The art must be suitable for viewing by children.

Artists submitting images should be aware that there is no payment for
badge art chosen, and the artist gives Further Confusion the right to

on the insert and in the con program book. The artist retains all other
copyrights and reproduction rights beyond the above.

Submission deadline is November 1st, 2006. All qualifying submissions will
be seriously considered and we will choose 6 designs. All artists will be
notified by December 1st as to whether or not their submissions have been
chosen.

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/badgeart.php> 


3.  Conbook Submission Deadline Fast Approaching

Our conbook submissions guidelines are now up and available. Remember, our
book is once again all color this year, so we can accept color as well as
black and white submission. The deadline for submitting art or written
materials is November 1, 2006. We also have room for a couple of short
stories and other written materials. For all the info please see the
following:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/conbook_guidelines.php>


4.  Artshow Sold Out

As of now, the Artshow for FC2007 is sold out. We expect that
applications currently in the mail will fill in the remaining panels.
While we're excited that our show has filled in record time, we're also
sad that some artists will miss out. We'll do our best to have as many of
you in the show as possible.

If you'd like to be put on a waiting list, please send in your application
as usual and we'll inform you if you have guaranteed space, or if you're
on the waiting list. We won't bank any cheques until we can guarantee you
space. It is usual that some artists cancel, or reduce their panel numbers
leading up to the con, so don't give up hope just yet. Also, it's common
that unused panels become available at show, so even if we can't guarantee
you panels, you may want to plan to bring along a half or full panel's
worth of artwork "just in case". Tell us if you're doing this, so we can
keep you informed, and prepare our databases before the show. 


5.  Preliminary Schedule Now Online

A preleminary version of the schedule for Further Confusion 2007 is now
online at our WWW site, available at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/schedulebyday.php>!  This schedule
is connected directly into our scheduling system, so is subject to change
as we work on putting the year's convention together.  So, take a peek,
see what we have to offer now, and check back in the next few months as we
give you even more reason to make it out to San Jose, next January.


6.  Further Confusion 2007 announces Special Musical Guest

FC2007 is pleased to announce special music guests, Sub-level 03.  The
air will be buzzing with fresh energy and sounds as Sub-level 03 takes the
stage before you very ears.  Get your paws moving to the groove of SL3 in
fursuit or out and come party with SL3 on their Fallout tour show at
FC2007. 

<http://www.sublevel3.us/>


7.  Dealers Room Announcement

In November, we will be selecting at random people from the Dealer's Room
waiting list to be offered 12 half-table spaces for FC2007. In order to
be included in the selection, you should have your waiting list form sent
in by November 1st, 2006.  Please allow sufficient time for the USPS to
deliver it to us by that date. This will be the second round of random
drawing from the waiting list.  Those randomly chosen from the list will
be notified before the end of November.  If there is any space still
remaining after the second round is finished, it will be offered to people
on the waiting list by random drawing prior to the convention as and when
space becomes available.

Application forms for space in the Dealer's Room and Furry Marketplace, as
well as rules governing each area, can be found at:
 
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/dealers.php>. 

Please e-mail dealers at furtherconfusion.org if you have any questions. 


8.  Furry Marketplace Announcement

Starting November 1st, 2006, Further Confusion will be accepting
applications for purchase of 10 more spaces in our Furry Market Place
outside the main dealers room.

These spaces are available on a first come, first served basis. However,
we will not accept any forms postmarked prior to November 1st, 2006. If

10. Events Announcements

Do we have Species Panels for FC2007?

We have the usual suspects:  canids, dragons & scalies, felines, foxes,
marsupials, minotaurs and more, mustelids, rodents, ungulates, and wolves.
New offerings include aquatic furs, avians, and hyenas (which may be a new
aspect for canids).

Of unique interest are:
A panel on Kzinti by our GOH Jerry Pournelle and Matthew Joseph
Harrington: "A trenchcoat is probably not going to fool the enemy during a
war between different species. How was espionage conducted during the
Man-Kzin Wars?  Dr. Jerry E. Pournelle, Ph.D., computing expert and author
of The Children's Hour, and Matthew Joseph Harrington, author of Teacher's
Pet, have given examples in their work, and invite discussion."

And one for hybrids:
The Hybrid Panel summons you! If you are tired of panels for those "plain"
species,this is the place for you! Are you a cross breed of something fun
like a Wolf and a Tiger? Are you a mixture of something outragous like a
Dragon and a Penguin? Or maybe your something just plain weird,such as a
Spider-Hippo!
Whether you were created from evil expirements,Genetic DNA splicing, or
popped out of no where, this is the place to meet other like you in ways
never thought possible! Come see people and species never seen! All are
welcome, Hybrids and friends alike!

Some panels would still very much like additional panelists:
aquatic furs, bears & pandas or hyenas, hybrid furs, ungulates, and
wolves.  Rescue, Recovery, habitat, biology knowledge and/or any kind of
fan, literature, art, etc. knowledge are welcome.  Seize the opportunity
to show off what you know and love!


11. Next public meeting

Our next staff meeting will be November 11th starting at noon in the San
Jose Doubletree. Parking is free - just tell the parking attendant that
you're with Further Confusion when you arrive, and then get a sticker for
your parking slip in the meeting.


You know what? I'm sick of being in the van.

  Is there really a difference in the cooling effect between nylon and cotton?  I know that nylon won?t absorb nearly as much water as cotton, but in the case of cotton, isn?t there still water there to cool?
   
  You?ve recommended cotton in a costume with bad airflow, and nylon in a costume with good airflow.  Does a mascot-style costume with regular fur (like you?d find a Jo Ann) have good airflow or bad airflow?  Would the fur fabric be able to dissipate the water, or would it collect there?  Would I be correct in assuming that a cotton style hood is better in a mascot style costume, as there would not be a lot of airflow in the head?
    One thing I don?t understand is why the Under Armour shirts are made of polyester instead of nylon.  Fleece material is polyester, and fairly warm too.  Perhaps the polyester fabric is softer?
   
  Thank you for the advice.


Lance Ikegawa <furtech at akela.com> wrote: A lot of the professional suit-performers (mascot, creature fx, etc.) 
have a routine they do that starts at least a day before they're going 
to be in costume.  This involved lots of hydrating (water, diluted 
gatorade, etc.)  and not taking long, hot showers (starting at least a 
day before).  Just take quick (like, 3 minute) cold showers.  If you 
take a hot shower (or soak in a bath or jacuzzi) on the day you're going 
to be in-costume, you will sweat like a pig.  Your skin can absorb (and 
then discharge) a LOT of water.

The type of undergarment will depend on the costume: with a 
loose-fitting mascot-style costume (with lots of air gaps) a nylon 
spandex unitard is best, since there is air for the moisture to 
evaporate away to.  As you move, this air is circulated in and out (you 
will often feel cooler walking easily than standing stock-still). 

For tight-fitting suits that do not breathe well (like many muscle-suits 
and Storm Trooper suits), cotton spandex is best.  You'll have to change 
it out more often (probably hourly), so bring a lot of extras because 
they'll get soaked.  I know some people who use those headbands that you 
soak in water in the summer and wear to keep cool, only they use them in 
reverse: they wear them dry and let them absorbe the water.  If you're 
REALLY desperate to not soak your suit, you can actually use disposeable 
diapers (or anything that will absorb water and store it)-- but I've 
never been that frantic.

There are exceptions: if you have an open-face costume or headless (like 
a "Cats" type costume), use nylon unitards.  Full head costumes create 
an enormous amount of heat and moisture build-up.  Without the head on, 
I can wear a full muscle suit covered in fur all day and only feel warm; 
put the head on and I'm starting to feel it in less than an hour.

Also, if there -is- air circulation use nylon spandex.  Inflateable 
costumes, costumes made with NFT fur and/or reticulated foam 
(open-celled foam) breathe enough to wick away the moisture faster than 
it can build up. 

I've not yet used the Under Armour line yet, so I'm not sure how 
effective it is (or not).  I use standard Baltog nylon or cotton spandex 
unitards for just about everything.  Even though nylon does send the 
moisture through, any covering will help to prevent the nasty elements 
of sweat from mucking up your costume.  I also thoroughly douse the 
costume (often turning it inside-out) with Endbac II.  Sometimes a 
quarter of a can on one costume and head.  The stink is from bacteria in 
your sweat and on your skin: if you destroy the bacteria, the costume 
won't stink.  My partner-in-crime learned this when she was doing 
maintenance on the Ripper costumes in "Tank Girl": they were shooting in 
a copper mine in Tuscon in high summer (110+ temps) all day.  When they 
missed -one- costume-- boy did they know it!  Whew!

Speaking of hygene, being well-scrubbed and not stinky -before- getting 
into your costume will go a long way to keeping it clean and 
stink-free.  As I said above, though: the day you're going to wear the 
costume (and the day before if you want to sweat even less), take quick 
cold showers (turn the water off during soaping) and you'll be clean and 
won't stink up your suit!

The difference is in what the material does with moisture: nylon spandex 
does not absorb water as fast as cotton spandex-- and much of the water 
it does absorb is transmitted through the material. Cotten will hold 
more water; nylon won't hold as much, keeping more sweat on your skin 
(and only passing some through). Neither has any real "cooling effect"; 
both are another layer of material that holds heat in. Both -do- move 
moisture (sweat) away from the body, helping to cool by evaporation. 
That's why a lot of suit-wearers don't wear unitards (just shorts and a 
t-shirt that they change out constantly). The more sweat you can get 
away from your skin, the cooler you will feel (evaporative cooling). 
Either material does help to filter the stinky stuff from getting to 
your suit.

With mascot-styled costumes (with regular fur) the best material depends 
on several points:
--How much do you sweat? If you sweat a lot, wear cotton. Change out 
when you feel soaked.
--How long will you be in costume? Long time (more than 20 minutes to 
one hour), wear nylon and suffer (but you won't have a wet-feeling 
costume-- ick)
--What kind of activity? If you're in a parade or dancing a rave, cotton 
will keep you cooler, but you will get soggy (no hugs! awful feeling!). 
If you can change out to other cotton clothing (even pajamas), you'll be 
cooler and have more endurance.

With mascot-styled suits and normal fake fur, you have room for more 
bulky under-clothing, so t-shirts and pajamas are great for this.

The nice thing about mascot-style suits is that you can also just go 
with shorts (with a bra if you're female): suits without foam-padding 
can be washed to get sweat and stink out after you use it. The reason a 
lot of professionals use t-shirts and shorts is that things like 
unitards are an extra layer of insulation, making the suit hotter. 
Liberal use of Endbac II after each wear should keep the suit from 
smelling for a weekend's con use (several hours of use a day). Wash and 
thoroughly dry (like, hang it in a dry, light place for a couple of 
days) before storing it or you'll get mildew (and that's almost 
-impossible- to get out!).

Tight-fitting suits often have foam padding: tougher to wash, so we 
suffer a little more to save on maintenance later. Tight-fitting suits 
without padding need 'em because otherwise the sweat directly goes onto 
the fur backing, making for gross, wet costumes.

I find the cooling effect comes from the wetness.  The (even warm) air hittign the wet unitard actually chills you even when in suit, any air movement has a chilling effect with a nylon/lycra blended skin, it's a nic ebenefit and makes for quicker recovers.  a dip into the headless lounge for 15-20 minutes soem water i'm good to go out again withtotu haveing to de suit.

The primary reasons though i wear an undersuit is 1) ro protect my suit (and thsoe huggign me) from my sweat, the only part of my suit that gets damp i s my butt which no one hugss anyway (udner the tail and small of my back) and the inside of my head.  and 2) to project my skin from the not so comfortable fur backing, it also makes teh suit easier to get on and of fit glides even when i'm soaked, try gettign a soaked fursuit off your bare skin.

but i do find i have better endurance and dotn feel as hot wearing it the material doesn't keep any heat in...it travels right through it, it i snot insulatign at all, in fact quite the opisette it conducts the heat away

in general, natural fibres (Cotton, linen, and wool) breathe better,
insulate better, and are more absorbent than synthetic fibres (nylon
and polyester). Silk, and her wood derived artificial sister, rayon,
have properties somewhere between natural and synthetic, though their
fibers are the strongest, and seem to be even stronger when wet.

What does this mean to a fursuiter?

If you want to stay cool, you will want to wear natural fibers under your suit.

Message-ID: <20061024201549.26025.qmail@web52015.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Just a heads-up for you, from MFF's Programming Dept.:

MFF has a NEW special event planned for fursuiters
(and non-fursuiters) 
that starts right after Opening Ceremonies.
It's one of MFF's "County Fair" themed events.
If you want to participate, make sure you get there at
1PM on FRIDAY to 
SIGN UP!

Here's the info:

COUNTY FUR PAGEANT ?-- SIGN UP, ELIMINATION, &
REHEARSAL
Do you have the qualities the judges are (arbitrarily)
looking for in 
our 
MFF 2006 County Fur Pageant winner?  Is it Dignity?
Elegance? Charisma? 
Having perfected a ?royal wave?? Not having TP stuck
to your foot? ? 
Nobody 
knows, but our judges say they will know ?It? when
they find it.  Maybe 
YOU 
have what it takes!
ELIBIBILITY:  Open to ANY AGE, GENDER, or SPECIES
[fursuiters, humans, 
whatnots ? i.e., all attendees are eligible].
TO SIGN UP:   Arrive at 1 PM sharp on FRIDAY, and
compete to be in the 
actual Pageant, to follow.
After Sign-Up and some simple elimination rounds (just
talking and 
walking, 
no ?talent show? or anything complicated), the judges
will choose only 
30 
entrants to compete in the actual Pageant. 
Eliminations may go 
quickly, so 
arrive on time to participate.  The last part of this
event is reserved 
to 
"rehearse" the lucky 30 that are chosen to be in the
actual Pageant.
WARNING:  PG RATED behavior and appearance are
-mandatory- for 
participants.  This is an abbreviated furry version of
those clich?d 
county 
fair pageants, after all, so join the roleplay fun. 
Non-PG behavior 
will 
result in immediate elimination and loss of any
titles/prizes won.

COUNTY FUR PAGEANT!   [FIRST TIME EVER EVENT  . . .
possibly ANYWHERE]
Ever been to a County Fair ?beauty pageant??  Well,
this is our own 
warped 
Furry version, in abbreviated form ? and for us,
everyfur is 
beautiful.  From the previous Elimination event,
perhaps 30 contestants 
may 
make it into this Pageant.  On our runway, there will
be music and 
strutting galore!  There?s no time for a talent
competition, but 
undoubtedly there will be ?hamming it up? involved.
Nobody really knows 
what the judges will be looking for, but they say
they?ll know ?It? 
when 
they see it.  Our Judges will select 3 finalists, and
then pick ONE to 
be 
our Midwest FurFest 2006 COUNTY FUR PAGEANT Winner. 
Our County Fur 
Pageant 
Winner and Runners-Up will be awarded prizes and will
be given some 
royal 
raiment (crown, sashes, etc.) that they can wear
during the weekend, 
and in 
the Fursuit Parade.  Of course, they won't be sitting
on a parade 
float, 
but the County Fur Pageant Winner and the Runners-Up
will march in the 
Fursuit Parade, in a ?place of honor?.

Don't think so... 

He's a "don't call us, we'll call you" kinda guy.

He's also in the top 3 positions for being my hero for suit making.  Has been ever since the Shen costume.

Have you seen those 'puzzle mat' kind of things? That is, the outer edges 
of the mats fit the other mats perfectly, forming a walking area, another 
larger square, that kind of thing? They may be a bit thick, but they're 
great for walking. You can use slippers, flipflops, or sandals as well.

I've seen them out at the local membership warehouses as well as some 
hardware stores and maybe some discount stores in black and colored. If 
I'm counting right, they're in packs of 4-6, up to an inch thickness.

I know a counselor who has her initials in them on her wall, the smaller 
kind that you pull put the letters and replace them.

Gotta agree with what Karen D and Simon S say about carpet. I wouldn't 
even consider using it for feet for those reasons.

More suggestions can be found in the fursuit FAQ/Wiki.

I actually had a question about a post that J.T. had made. I was wondering if there could be more clarification about what kind of material this is and if it's beneficial for sutiers (especially since it, from what it says, doesn't let sweat through and keeps the suit dry). It definitely sounds like something I'd be interested in investing in.

I've found some incredibly awesome fabric that is a supplex, and it's 
completely waterproof... yet comfortable like cotton, and strechy like 
spandex.  My hubby wears it for his performances (not in suit... but his 
show is HIGHLY aerobic)  he can do two 45 minute sets and be sweating like 
crazy under the shirt, but there's not a drop of sweat to be seen on the 
outside of the shirt.

Hello Fellow Fursuiters and Furiends:

It's that time of the year for . . .

. . . the 30th Occational Pasadena Doo Dah Parade on Sunday the 19th of
November (that's the weekend before Thanksgiving)!  If you've got a
fursuit, if you wanna show off, if you didn't suit up on Halloween, if
you wanna be wacky, or even if you just wanna hang with (and maybe help)
a bunch of furries/scalies/featheries . . . then YOU are invited to walk,
march, skip, hop, gallop, skate, bike, pogo stick, or unicycle with the
"Coast to Coast Critters" fursuit brigade!

Here's how to participate: 1) simply e-mail me at dlely at juno.com telling
me you'll be there.  2) Check out the Parade's official web site at
http://www.pasadenadoodahparade.info/ for further information and maps. 
Then on Sunday the 19th of November: 3) meet me and all of the other
participants in Memorial Park (85 East Holly Street in Pasadena CA 91103)
before 10:30 AM.  4) Pay your $10.00 per person entry fee to the
organizers (The Light Bringer Project, a nonprofit arts organization). 
5) Wait in the park and have some fun . . . then jump in the Parade at
11:30 AM and have more fun!

But wait there's more!  After the parade everyfur usually chows down at a
popular Pasadena watering hole!

If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me.  Hope to see ya all
there!

Wow, This is a little weird to ask but the list didn't have much info on 
this. How do you sew fur to form fit to a female's breasts without showing seams 
in short fur? I'm serious. Ladies (or gentlemen who know) give me a hand please.

If you have a walking foot machine it shouldn't show seams, if not use a seam ripper to pull the fur through the seams. We also use a wire BBQ brush to brush out seams and it works great.. good luck.

Why not let everyone else see the responses for this? This can be an 
interesting thing to post. When Samantha Kemple was made, some things were 
made formfitting. This can be great for those doing Ren costumes and 
wearing the upper body furry part under the dresses.

I'd suspect you cover a regular bra with the fur and then go from there. 
Heck, I'm just guessing at one thing. Or use a 'duct tape dummy' or 
lifecast pattern of that area?

LOL first you sew darts in the form so it gives the desired shape.. Then you 
brush the seams with a wire brush.. then you end up with a shape and no 
seams showing.... But a mascot with breasts looks odd.. in my opinion.

Couple of minor points regarding the fursuit parade...

Are the aisles wide enough for fursuiters to pass "cleanly?" - and do we
know if anyone had anything broken or damaged when the fursuit went
through the dealers room?

>>not really, when AC was at 500 attendees, parade was like 50.  the
>>year we had 1100 attendees, we broke 100, this year, 2000 broke 200.
>>    
>>
Yep, most cons follow the 10% rule, some more, some less. Depends
greatly on the makeup of the attendees and whether there is a strong
fursuiting programming track or not. The availability of less expensive
suits (mass produced <$500) and partials are also making it a little
easier to get "in on the fun." But unfortunately, AC this year didn't
break "officially" break 200, as we were 197 strong as I recall the
dorsai's count.

The aisles are unfourtunately not wide enough for a
whole parade.  If a couple fursuiters at a time pass
through, there isn't too big of a deal but if 150+ in
a parade pass through, it's going to jam the aisles
and block customers...and keep dealers from making $$$
(which aparently some dealers can't spare for a few
minutes).

We have a compromise with the Dealer's Den though
where the route of the parade will be posted in there
on the day of the parade and, if the dealers choose
that they want to see it, they'll temporarly shut down
for a few minutes to go view the parade.

It's the best we can do until we get into a newer
hotel.

My appologies for putting this into the mailboxes of anyone not attending MFF - there isn't a list specifically for MFF fursuiters, and I wanted to get this out where as many suiters attending MFF as possible will see it.

Due to technical difficulties, there was a last-minute fursuit track panel addition to the MFF schedule that didn't fully make it into all schedule-related publications, so I want to let everyone know what this panel is about. There's also an important time and location change for this panel: it is going to be at 2 PM on Sunday in Arlington Heights.

Kinetic Fursuits is a panel I am hosting on how to design fursuits to allow for more realistic creature-like movements and body shaping. As an avid professional puppeteer and fursuiter, I routinely incorporate puppetry design concepts into my unique personal fursuits, creating characters that can do things not possible in more typical fursuit designs. The goal of this panel is to let others get an inside look at how my designs work while helping to answer a question I commonly hear: "How does he do that?" This is a fursuit construction panel touching a little on performance, but anyone (non-suiters, too) who's curious about my unique fursuit characters is invited to come and learn more about them.

Once again, this panel has been moved in order to allow MFF's fursuit building furs the chance to attend both Fursuit Construction 2 and Kinetic Fursuits. The Kinetic Fursuits' panel will be at 2 PM on Sunday in Arlington Heights, immediately following the Advanced Fursuit Performance panel.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

To All Doo Dah Paraders:

I wanted to thank everyone so much who came out this past Sunday to

everyone did wonderfully, and the spectators lining the streets seemed
very excited to see us!

Our Escorts (who carried our banner and kept us hydrated):
Brown Wolf
Firewolf (new this year)
Hoof Hearted
Tiger Tabbie
Trigger Happy Squirrel

Fursuiting Participants (who braved flying marshmallows and tortillas):
Donkey as Lambert (new this year)
Hunterkitty (new in suit this year)
Jazman Concolor as King Lion (new this year)
Sahara as Joust (in his new suit)
Scruff E. Coyote (on skateboard)
Single Speed Chetah (from back east)
Tommi Tigre as Rajah (new this year)
WereWoof (appearing as such for the last time)
Viperman as PT Skunk (new this year)

Thanks again to all and hope to see everyone plus even more next year!

I also could not get video.

Those cheetah's panties are mildly disturbing.

Se?ior Single Speed. And I gotta wonder... is that an anatomically  
correct suit you have there? :)

  Its that magical time of year when the stores start carrying those animal-feet fuzzy slippers! 
 
 When the Walmart manager took us Wii-campers to the layaway aclove to purchase our video game glee, I noticed some dinosaur-looking fuzzy slippers/feet. They come in three colours: light pink, brown, and black. They have three toes and claws. Also, Hot Topic is carrying black cat slippers with four toes and little claws, and these even have a pink pawpad design on the bottoms! They were 15.99, and I think the Wal-mart ones are around 10. 
 
 So stock up while you can! They're great "cheat-feet" for fursuits.

Subject: FL: FC2007: Fur Your Eyes Only - November Mission Briefings
Message-ID: <20061130164018.GA9832@urocyon.critter.net>

Dear frith, my covers blown as wide as my ears are long and theres no way
I am gonna get out of this one. I am sending this communique via the
secret carrot in the Farmers Market. Hopefully HQ will get it and get it
out to the agents. Oh man..here they come....

In this issue:1.  Hotels - both of them - sold out
2.  Pre-Registration Cutoff Date Reminder
3.  Hotel reservation Cutoff Date Reminder
4.  Artshow Sold out
5.  Preliminary Schedule Published
6.  Go-fur Hunt!
7.  Extra AV Staff needed
8.  Special Musical Guest
9.  Fursuit Badge Procedure
10. Next Public Meeting



FC2007 November Mission Briefing:

1.  Hotels - both of them - sold out

The San Jose Doubletree is completely sold out at this point. Sadly, our
overflow hotel is now also sold out. We are in communication with the
Holiday Inn to see if an expansion is possible, but if not please see our
page on other hotels that are nearby. 

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/other_hotels.php> 


2.  Pre-Registration Cutoff Date Reminder

Just a reminder that with the holidays fast approaching, the deadline for
preregistration cutoff is December 30. Standing in lines makes any agent
open target ya know. Avoid that fate and save $5 at the same time!


3.  Hotel reservation Cutoff Date Reminder

December 30 is also the cutoff for hotel reservations. Not that there are
likely to be any left at the convention rate by then...but you never know,
there may be some agents who just can't make it. Pesky henchman and all
that sort of thing.


4.  Artshow Sold out

The Artshow for FC2007 is sold out. We expect that applications currently
in the mail will fill in the remaining panels. While we're excited that
our show has filled in record time, we're also sad that some artists will
miss out. We'll do our best to have as many of you in the show as
possible.

If you'd like to be put on a waiting list, please send in your application
as usual and we'll inform you if you have guaranteed space, or if you're
on the waiting list. We won't bank any cheques until we can guarantee you
space. It is usual that some artists cancel, or reduce their panel numbers
leading up to the con, so don't give up hope just yet. Also, it's common
that unused panels become available at show, so even if we can't guarantee
you panels, you may want to plan to bring along a half or full panel's
worth of artwork "just in case". Tell us if you're doing this, so we can
keep you informed, and prepare our databases before the show. 


5.  Preliminary Schedule Published

A preliminary version of the schedule for Further Confusion 2007 is now
online at our WWW site, available at:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/schedulebyday.php>

This schedule is connected directly into our scheduling system, so is
subject to change as we work on putting the year's convention together.
But things are getting pretty well locked down. So, take a peek, see what
we have to offer now, and check back as we give you even more reason to
make it out to San Jose, in January.


6.  Go-fur Hunt!

Even with all of our staff, we need spur of the moment help too. New to
the whole con thing? Wanna see how it works behind the scenes? Can't
afford the membership? Or just wanna help out? Gofuring is for you then.
Head up to the Gofur Den! 20 hours of your time from Thursday til Monday
and you get access to gofur crash, food, and the option of compensation or
a free membership to FC 2008!


7.  Extra AV Staff needed

AV Tech crew is accepting applications for at-convention staff for all
positions at all events.  No experience necessary.   Staff Registration

your parking slip in the meeting.


Technology gets better everyday. That's fine. But most of the time all you
need is a stick of gum, a pocket knife and a smile.

Message-ID: <d23d76ca0611302313q251d118ag222d4dc7e3b722c3@mail.gmail.com>

I was working on making a new fursuit for my self. Well my BF asked if
others wear an old fursuit when they are making a new fursuit as I do. With
out giving it any thought at all I said. "Of course others do." As the days
passed. I started to think about just that question. Do others wear fursuits
or other odd clothing when making a fursuit?

So I'm going to put that same question out to all of you. Do you wear an old
fursuit or anything else odd when your making a new fursuit?

I might wear any of or all of monster feet or hooves (The hooves would be on
my feet. I cant work with my hand hooves on =b), bodysuit and a fursuit head
when I'm making a new fursuit.

Am I weird even for furries?

If I'm correct in thinking what you mean, it must be REALLY tricky to sew something when you're inside a bulky, cumbersome costume, with less than 100% vision. Also, wearing big ass paws would be pretty risky when sewing. They could get mangled in the machine easily, and hand sewing would be torture trying to hold a TINY needle with slippery fur.

Y'alls are crazy, and making me crack up here!!

Sometimes I'll wear paw-shaped slippers on my feet, but I need to be  
able to move freely when I sew. Plus it's really hot under the lights  
in my sewing studio so anything beyond a t-shirt quickly becomes too  
much to work in.

Occasionally I'll take some scraps or oops pieces and turn them into  
a hat or something and wear that while continuing my project. I have  
one that started out being a onsie footie, and I hemmed it and turned  
it into a Schiaparelli -esque hat. I even wore it out to dinner later  
that evening. HA!

My girlfriend typically wears ears and tails all the time, so she's  
kinda suited-up when we are working together.


This is a great thread. I want to hear from more people! I think I am  
going to cross-post this to the fursuit LJ because it's just too  
funny not to!

Perhaps a product called "Rigid Wrap" could help  you.  Its like a very thin
bandage with casting powder on it..  you smear vasoline on your face dip
these strips in watere and place them upon your head. I suggest having a
helper and dont cover up your nose.

heh... Reminds me of the time when I was doing WerGoyle, I totally trashed 
two rooms just doing it. I had to clean them up just to walk around easily 
and go to sleep that night, however late it was. However, cleaning off the 
sticky spray glue in places was another story.

When I do my creations, I just wear regular clothing. Sometimes regular 
shorts when I'm trying on a bodysuit to check its appearance and fit. I 
prefer handsewing even though I got an all-metal machine here.

Anyone know those warm "bodysack" things made with fleece using either 
zippers or snaps? Anyone ever try making something like that with fur, 
making a "padded suit" inside, but making it look like a furry sleeved 
sleeping bag? We're talking warm, even when you turn off the furnace for 
the night or it's failed.

Hmm... Another fursuit idea there... Full body padded thing that only your 
helper can get you out of. I think we talked about this awhile ago on 
another thread, "24 hour suit technology," if I remember right.

I've worked on drawing up a few designs like both of these, along with a 
few other ideas...there is also a Yahoo group for such ideas as well, if 
you shoot me an off list email I'll pass the address along.

You can have a full head and shoulders lifecast done of yourself. Either 
that or a casting without the face. This will allow you to make the head 
easily fit you. If you read through the fursuit FAQ/wiki, it'll tell you 
in detail how it's done. I wouldn't suggest doing it to yourself. Best to 
have someone do it to you.

However, those styrofoam heads are smaller than normal heads. A cheap 
method would be to measure your own head, foam out the styrofoam head to 
your head's measurement in places, then cover with duct tape or something 
like that.

If you do have claustrophobia, I wrote something in the FAQ/wiki about 
just this, having done it to my brother who does have claustrophobia.

I would not suggest using Rigid Wrap at all. It takes too long to dry. 
Medical plaster bandages from a medical supply house will do better.

How do you do the eyes - the look very lifelike.

Subject: FL: Kids Expo: April 2007
Message-ID: <20061204174418.4426.qmail@web30405.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hey guys, Grizz asked me to look into putting together
the group for Kids Expo next year.  Unfortunately it's
looking like he won't be able to attend so if
necessary I'll try and be the point person for this
event.  

The Kids Expo parade will take place in Poughkeepsie
on Sunday April 15th.  I don't have a time yet but if
it is similar to last year then it will take place
sometime late morning/early afternoon.  If anyone is
interested in joining please let me know.  I am going
to set up a post on the lj community fursuit_gigs
later today and will hopefully have more information
by the end of the week.

For anyone that wasn't able to attend last year, the
event was an absolute blast.  Should be similar to
last year, starts off as a parade around Poughkeepsie
(I believe it was about a mile, but I will confirm
this) and then moves towards the information booths
inside the rec center - which is mostly geared towards
a younger audience.  We interact with the kids
wandering around, it will be a bit crowded, some of us
were also able to use the indoor ice skating rink.

More info can be found on my old lj post about the
event:
http://freakylynx.livejournal.com/283060.html

Also, the co-sponsor for the event was very pleased
with our participation, below is a follow-up email he
recently mailed to Grizz.

"Just wanted to let you know that we are already
planning Kids Expo '07!!!  The dates are April 14 -
15, with the parade taking place on Sunday the 15th.
I am excited about the upcoming Expo, and am working
hard to smooth out some of the bumps I encountered
last year.
The Fursuiters were a HUGE attraction last year, and I
truly hope that you can be a part of Kids Expo '07
this coming April.  Please let me know if you think
you and your animals can make it again."


Hope to hear from everyone soon ^.^
-Lynx

Yes this is in Poughkeepsie NY which is in the Northern suburbs of NYC  along 
the Hudson River (East shore) valley.
 
I plan to be there.  Like last year, fits in nicely between the Easter  
Parade and the Ocean City NJ DooDah Parade.

Yes indeed, they have been holding a DooDah Parade in Ocean City NJ  since 
1986 and the "Rapid T. Rabbit and Friends" fursuit brigade has been   a part of 
it since 1995.  It's usually on the Saturday after Tax Day (i.e.  after April 
15) unless delayed due to the occurrence of Palm Sunday or  Easter.  All are 
welcome to join us!

It's a very lo-key family style parade. Very different then the Pasadena
Doodah Parade.

Pick your poison, imo.

Well not that low-key.  But Ocean City NJ does bill itself as  "America' 
Greatest Family Resort".
 
And our group gets support from Ocean City (like free hotel rooms and a  boat 
to use as a float) that we don't get in Pasadena.

Hi Furries!

I would like to buy a can of Endbac II to keep my suit smelling nice
and clean.  It seems to be difficult to find.  Can anyfur suggest a
U.S. retail vending chain that stocks this stuff?  Specifically one in
the Pacific Northwest or Northern California regions.

I've been using the Walmart brand for several years on a bunch of 'suits. I
think it works pretty well. At less then two bucks a can, it's a bargan.
It's easier to get then Enbac as well. Enbac needs to be ordered (usually by
the case) from a medical supply. No, it doesn't smell very good. But then
neither does Enbac, imo. But they both smell better then a dirty, damp
'suit. K-Mart has no equivalent product to my knowledge.

I just put Enbac into google and found this link

http://www.uclean.com/catalog/productInfo/chemicals/disinfectants/sc_johnson_endbac_ii_spray_disinfectant.html?sessid=a3f08de4e78e7e407544e060d817f3c3&sessid=a3f08de4e78e7e407544e060d817f3c3

They sell it by the case though but you can get it there.

I often see the Great Value Fresh Linen antibacterial spray disinfectant 
at Walmart as Rapid said. I've got a can with me as well as a couple cans 
of Endbac II. I don't know if they have the same thing at Kmart or Target. 
Maybe someone here on the list could check?

Rapid, you also said something about a similar product at NYC's Duane 
Reade drugstores? What was it again?

If you don't want to buy the stuff by the case of 12 cans, you might find 
it at some janitorial supply shops. I wouldn't suggest getting it via 
mailorder as many places will tack on hazardous materials fees besides the 
usual shipping charges.

However, if you're able to get the gallon liquid sizes, you're pretty much 
set for a long while. Just pour the stuff into trigger sprayers and go 
from there. You may have to dilute the stuff a bit. I might be a bit wrong 
on that.

The active ingredients are n-Alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chlorides and n-alkyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chlorides with Ethyl Alchohol.

If you can find something at K-Mart with that mix it's similar to Endbac II (though the Duane Reade version has a slightly lower ratio of the N-Alkyl ingredients than real Endbac 2)

Hi
I have come up against a problem with my proposed Fursuit and the 
"extra" things that I cannot seem to solve with the research that I 
have been doing into it.
I am looking for some help in finding a pattern for the TUNIC  ... in 
the artwork for the suit that I am building. Someone suggested that 
it is similar to 15th Century French Military uniforms, but I have 
not been able to find anything similar while searching through the 
library or the net. Hopefully someone here can give me a pointer to 
something I can use.
Here is a link to the Artwork for the 
suit:  http://www.geocities.com/kliah_ts/Chasseuse.jpg

Thank you,

Walmart actually sells their Great Value antibacterial spray in two
different scents. One is summer scent, which doesn't smell much like
Endbac. The other is fresh linen scent, which smells very similar to
Endbac. The ingredients in all of them are basically the same, though the
exact percentages differ a little. The big difference is that Endbac is
hard to find and $5 to $8 a can. The Walmart stuff is easy to find and only
$1.75 a can.

The principles are sound, and are the same which have been arrived at by
others either independently or through comparative research, development 
and innovation, including (but not limited to):

Great work.  It certainly works well with the armor and I love the braids at 
the sides.  This is a nice solution to the problem of mane falling into the 
eyes and I may do the same with my lion mask.  I will try to get some photos 
of the mask you did for me later in the week if I can find enough time.

this pic shows the costume fabric & the old feet.
I would like them to be ankle high so the end of the
legs on the bodysuit stays covering the feet.

SOUTHERN TAILS
The official newsletter of Furry Weekend Atlanta
February 16-18, 2007
Sheraton Gateway Hotel
Atlanta, GA, USA
http://www.furryweekend.com

IN THIS ISSUE

1. New (Old) Editor
2. What can you do with five dollars?
3. Dealers Den Space still available!
4. Hotel is filling up!
5. Programming Spotlight: Masquerade!
6. Programming Spotlight: First Convention Panel!

# NEW (OLD) EDITOR

I want to thank Spiral Gryphon for covering for me while I took care of some things. I'm happy to announce that Kiran Lightpaw is now back at the helm of Southern Tails and will be bringing you all the fantastic news from the Dogwood City once gain.

# WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH FIVE DOLLARS?

Pre-registering for Furry Weekend Atlanta will save you five dollars off our Attending and Sponsoring levels, and 20 dollars off our God-Level registration as compared to the cost at the door. So ... what can you do with five dollars? You can ... buy a meal at any of the restaurants within a short distance of the hotel or stay right within the Sheraton for a good meal. You can spend it at some of the dealers in the dealers den or artists in the artists alley and buy a badge commission! There's literally hundreds of things you can do with an extra five dollars in your pocket, but you won't have that extra cash if you don't pre-register! (http://www.furryweekend.com/registration)

# DEALERS DEN SPACE STILL AVAILABLE

Got something you want to sell? Well, we have space for you to sell it! Registration for the dealer's room for this year's FWA is open. Prices start at $70 for one table and one membership. Included in this price is free power and internet (on a first come, first served basis) and free lunches Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Full details, including how to register, can be found at our website (http://www.furryweekend.com/dealers). If you have any questions, feel free to email us at
dealersden at furryweekend.com

# HOTEL IS FILLING UP!

We've already filled our first block of rooms and have expanded to a second block! The Sheraton is a much nicer hotel than our previous home at the Holiday Inn and features, among other things, all interior rooms! That's right - no more freezing in February walking down to the con! In addition, a select number of Furry Weekend Atlanta hotel patrons may find a special gift for booking rooms early! Furry Weekend Altanta has negotiated a special Furry Weekend Atlanta rate for the convention of $89.00 per night for single, double, triple and quad occupancy. However, to take advantage of this rate, you must contact Sheraton Reservations at 1-800-325-3535 and request the "Furry Weekend Atlanta" room block and rate OR book online through our website (http://www.furryweekend.com/hotel).

# PROGRAMMING SPOTLIGHT: MASQUERADE

The Fursuit Masquerade is a two part event where fursuits and fursuiters will be judged on both technical and performance criteria, with awards for the top winners in each category. Best of all, the performance session on Sunday afternoon will be open for everyone to come and watch, so participants will get to show off their talents for an excited audience of their fellow furs. Competition will occur in two categories, Novice and Master, and the Masquerade Performance will have an Exhibition (i.e. unjudged) session for anyone who wants to do a more traditional variety show style act. Full details, including rules and guidelines will be posted to the Furry Weekend Atlanta website at a later date: (http://www.furryweekend.com/fs_activities)

# PROGRAMMING SPOTLIGHT: FIRST CONVENTION PANEL

Is this your first convention, or your hundredth? Either way, this Furry Weekend Atlanta original panel, first introduced in 2005 and each year a success, will be your introduction to convention culture. From complex subjects like etiquette to more mundane things like how to prevent the con funk and deal with PCD, our First Con panel is sure to help neophyte and seasoned veteran alike.

# VOLUNTEERS WANTED

Interested in lending a paw at Furry Weekend Atlanta? Let our volunteering director know! Contact him at volunteers at furryweekend.com.

# HAPPY HOLIDAZE FROM FURRY WEEKEND ATLANTA!

Furry Weekend Atlanta would like to wish all of our family (that's y'all!) the best of holiday wishes during this festive season. If you're traveling, travel safely. If you're shopping, look out for that guy about to deck you over a Nintendo Wii, and if you're just hanging out, have fun and be safe, because we want to see ALL of you in February in Atlanta!

Hi folks

I have been busy with a couple of projects and have decided to make a couple
of short instructional video's on them.

The fist is my animatronic tail wagging mechanism.  Many many thanks to
Wolftail for providing the inspiration.

One of the problems that I have when I am in my suit is that I get a LOT of
abuse from kids. This is usually tugging on the tail etc. So any work that I
do needs to beable to cope with this.

Here is a short 2min 2Mb WMV movie of the tails mechanism instructions.

http://marcwolf.org/tailwag.wmv

Oh - yes - you get to see the wolf out of his costume too.

Enjoy - please any feedback would be great as I plan to do a few more of
these. I have recently discovered PicAXE's - a really neat little chip(s)
that are perfect for the amature hobbiest and I will basing most of my work
around these.

To come.

Controller glove so I can send instructions to the master animation
controller.

Master animation controller with programming details on how to get it to
work.

Possibly ears, nose, jaw, and muzzle flaps work too.

I truly hopes tha this can help folks realise their dreams of making their
costumes more than what they currently are

Take Care

Marcwolf

Subject: FL: fursuit trading cards?
Message-ID: <956609.2117.qm@web51407.mail.yahoo.com>

Someone mentioned a bit ago about trading cards?
heres my 2 bits...

Im the graphic artist at a printing company in
Scottsdale, az
I can print 2 sided trading cards for "theoretically"
cost.
It would all depend on how many furries are
interested.

if there are like 300 interested, thats 300 sets of
300 cards.
But I still dont see cost being too huge per furry.

please INDIVIDUALLY EMAIL ME if interested.
Otherwise we will probably flood the list. Hehehee

Also, help me brainstorm with "stats" on the card.
character name, race/animal type, age?, height?
Besides my vast Photoshop & illustrator skills, 
I have a Magic: The Gathering trading card generator
somewhere
so they will look really sharp!

I think a sketch of your character (if you have one)
is possible too to put on there.
let me know asap.

That looks good. It will help with K9 and feline and maybe reptile fursuit
tails. To bad it wont work for equine fursuits. Are tails move to fast and
random for such a device. Are tails are for fly swatting not balance.

Hi Donkey

There should be no trouble adapting this for an equine tail.

Basically you shorten the tail and put a hinge section at the top so that
the remaining tail can move more freely.
The rest of the tail can be  something looser like heavy cord so it can add
to the flick.

Servo's can move VERY fast if needed. You are looking at 0.3 seconds to move
a quarter turn.

The randomness is just a function of the controller and that can be
programmed into one easily. The PicAXE has a random function which will
generate a random number. One can then use that to send a new position to
the tail and you get a  'Flick' or 'Twitch' depending on the difference
between the last servo position and the new one.

Servo's are very interesting little mechanisms and I plan to do a small
video talk on them and using them.

Hope this helps..

Take Care

Marcwolf

I am making a full sized lion mask for Don, in this system we have 2 driver 
boards on one pair of I -Theater glasses
and 2 video cameras for a stereo vision system. here is a link. Depending on 
camera type highly sensitive IR cameras will give you the
ability to see in night vision mode with IR leds for illumination

Brilliant.. Simply Brilliant.

A while ago I saw a similar idea (back in mid 90's)  and this was a heads up
display for  people working on airforece equipment. It would  give them an
overlay schematic on whatever they were working on.

But this certainly has come a LONG way from that.

A couple of questions.

You needed 2 driver boards. Is this because you could not tap into the video
feed for each eyepiece or was the information to each eyepiece already
processed.

If one could put up with the lost of depth perception then you could just
use one driver board.

Hopefully the price will come down for the units as I can see a lot of
possibiliites re costuming. One would nolonger be limited to having to look
out of the suit. And the little camera's are small enough to be put
anywhere - like in a nose.

Take care Lionel and many many thanks for sharing.

While difficult to tell from pictures alone this looks like a very good way 
to have vision out of a full size head.  It certainly is better then the 
limited view one gets from a head that has only mouth or corner of the eye 
viewing.  For use in LARP the IR feature would certainly have great 
benefits.

I look forward to seeing how this all comes together.

I was just searching through photos on Timduru's
site..  

You feel old when you look at his site, find pictures
of your first costume and look and noticed that it was
posted 3254 days ago...  Exactly 31 days short of 9
years ago.  That is assuming that the upload figures
are correct, which, by memory, seem to be.

UG.  Which means I've been subscribed to this list
slightly longer then that...

I wonder who else, apart from Furtech, has been around
that long.

*Holy Crap*

Me Me Me Me! Of course, you're only as old as your fursuit looks :) I 
have been on the furry internet thingy since Sept. 96 and celebrated 10 
years in furry net world then. Kissed my old 100 mhz computer and 
everything.  Funny though, I still have not replaced my fursuit. Haven't 
built another one and haven't bought one, had the desire but NOPE. My 
dog is my dog. SO, piccies taken as early as CFE96 look just like ones 
taken at MFF2006(with different hatware, oh, I didn't have a tail at CFE. )

Remember when there was maybe 20-30 fursuits at a con? Now there's furs 
that have 20-30 fursuits :)

Well - you can always look at your first suit and then your current suit and
see how far your skill in making them have come?

Take Care

Yippee Coyote celebrated his tenth birthday on Halloween this year. His public
event debut was the 1996 Pasadena Doodah parade with the veteran Rapid T.
Rabbit, who's been around for many years longer.

It's funny...

My first suit is now owned by Tyger Cowboy...

I still have my second suit, which remains my only
suit.

But, since I've lost a ton of weight, (almost 65lbs in
6mos) he's turning into more of a Sharpei, so, it's
soon going to be time to see about replacing him... 
But, I've been informed by my wife that I'm not
allowed to sell the suit, as, I used it to propose to
her in. :)

*g* yeah that's quite scary ;)
I was getting the same reaction looking at old pictures there too ;))
Otherwise yes, normally the 'posted date' is the file date,
I always try to keep it as the original date to keep track of it :)

Now we'll feel even older when it displays:
Posted *buffer overflow* days ago ;)

Just curious, which picture was your first costume btw ?

I would not blame you there about why... To her it has that special 
sentimental feeling! As for me I'm like still considered a put in the fandom 
since I only have one partail that I have had since I turned 18 this year 
and have been part of it for the past 3 years.

Subject: FL: FC2007: Fur Your Eyes Only - December Mission Briefing
Message-ID: <20061221220029.GA21370@corvus.critter.net>


December Mission Briefing:

Just a few quick notes before everyone heads off for the holidays. Safe
travel and happy holidays to all our agents, villains and faithful henchmen.
We'll have one final mission briefing for you immediately after the Jan 6
meeting.

In this briefing:
1. Pre-Registration Cutoff Date Reminder
2. Hotel Reservation Cutoff Date Reminder
3. Fursuit Badge Procedure
4. Artshow Sold out
5. Preliminary Schedule Published
6. Furly Edition Zero
7. Fursuit Airbrush Techniques panel
8. Next Public Meeting



1. Pre-Registration Cutoff Date Reminder

Just a reminder that with the holidays fast approaching, the deadline for
preregistration cutoff is December 30. Standing in lines makes any agent an
open target ya know. Avoid that fate and save $5 at the same time!

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/onlinereg.php>

2. Hotel Reservation Cutoff Date Reminder

December 30 is also the cutoff for hotel reservations. Not that there are
likely to be any left at the convention rate by then...but you never know,
there may be some agents who just can't make it. Pesky henchman and all that
sort of thing.


3. Fursuit Badge Procedure

If you have a fursuit, are pre-registered, and need a fursuit badge, here's
what to do. Before January 1, 2007, send a picture of your fursuit to
fursuit-badges at furtherconfusion.org and include the following information in
the email:

- Your real name
- The fursuit name
- Your registration confirmation number

The file can be any standard picture format (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.) at 300
DPI with a usable area of 450 by 600 pixels.

The first fursuit badge is free (though a donation to the convention would
be appreciated), while subsequent badges are $5 each.

Photographs for fursuit badges will also be taken at the convention.
Please see the times that will be posted at the Registration Desk for the
hours this will be offered.


4. Artshow Sold out

The Artshow for FC2007 is sold out. We expect that applications currently in
the mail will fill in the remaining panels. While we're excited that our
show has filled in record time, we're also
sad that some artists will miss out. We'll do our best to have as many of
you in the show as possible.

If you'd like to be put on a waiting list, please send in your application
as usual and we'll inform you if you have guaranteed space, or if you're on
the waiting list. We won't bank any cheques until we can guarantee you
space. It is usual that some artists cancel, or reduce their panel numbers
leading up to the con, so don't give up hope just yet. Also, it's common
that unused panels become available at show, so even if we can't guarantee
you panels, you may want to plan to bring along a half or full panel's worth
of artwork "just in case". Tell us if you're doing this, so we can keep you
informed, and prepare our databases before the show. 


5. Preliminary Schedule Published

A preliminary version of the schedule for Further Confusion 2007 is now
online at our WWW site, available at:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/schedulebyday.php>

This schedule is connected directly into our scheduling system, so is
subject to change as we work on putting the year's convention together. But
things are getting pretty well locked down. So, take a peek, see what we
have to offer now, and check back as we give you even more reason to make it
out to San Jose, in January.


6. Furly Edition Zero

The Furly Edition is your at con newsletter for all the latest news and
mission briefings. This includes Public party announcements, schedule
changes, and anything else that is general information at con. These
announcements should be text only and should be submitted to us by Jan 7,
2006 for Furly Edition Zero. That issue will be available at Registration.
The at con editions will have submission boxes placed at ConOps and our Info
Desk but if you have anything early, please send it to
newsletter at furtherconfusion.org no later than January 7.


7. Fursuit Airbrush Techniques panel

Lance Ikegawa and Eric Yee will be again be demonstrating their skill with
the airbrush Sunday at 1PM, and will be looking for a few volunteers to
help with the demonstration.  If you have any fursuit heads you'd like to
see a bit of touching up done on, make sure to bring them to the panel,
which will be held just outside of the convention entrance.  Have an idea
of what you'd like to see, and they will see what they can do to make it a
reality.


8. Next Public Meeting

Our next staff meeting will be January  starting at noon in the San
Jose Doubletree. Parking is free - just tell the parking attendant that
you're with Further Confusion when you arrive, and then get a sticker for
your parking slip in the meeting.


The world outside these walls is an illusion; it's not really there for
us. We're ghosts.

Message-ID: <cf6.5cd4122.32c46c6d@aol.com>

Hello.
     I am planning to eventually have a meet for fursuiters in Colorado, Yes 
I am aware of the existence of the web site Meetups.com but I hate putting 
more work into something that doesn't require it.
Anyway, I would like to have any fursuiter in Colorado or any surrounding 
state wanting to participate in the event E-mail this address so I can better 
figure out when and where would be the best time to hold his based on the 
schedules of the participants. Then hopefully the scattered bunch of fursuiters can 
be brought together.
Any tagalongs are welcome

1) It has to have been you who subscribed to the list: every
subscription is screened.  There is no way you involuntarily subscribed
or were subscribed by a third party to this list.

2) We aren't into bestiality, either.  Seems we do have something in
common after all.

3) The instructions to unsubscribe are below, at the end of every
message.  This is much faster than posting a message to the list
demanding to be unsubscribed.

What I cant believe is that he went to so much trouble to get signed up to
the mailing list and then left such a lame attack. I bet my 3 year old neice
can come up with something better.
