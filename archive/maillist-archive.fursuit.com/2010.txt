It's  just a single picture, but I'm rather pleased with it.  At MFF 2009, SpOrk and I posed for this picture in our full latex suits.  I am the one wearing the Blackstyle dog hood and SpOrk is wearing the feline gas mask.  I hope to eventually load up more pictures along with more yiffy pine marten photos as well in this coming year.

1. Gold Strike at Further Confusion 2010!

It's true ladies and gents. I saw the first nuggets today and I assayed
them as genuine gold nuggets from the strike area in Northern California.
It has been said that the first 3000 Argonauts who manage to make it to
Further Confusion 2010, even as a mere attendee, will get a sample from
their claim. Now you folks know that a good claim is worth more than stock
in the Pacific Union Railway, but many of those are just dead end tracks.

Be sure and check your tailings bag you will receive at Registration. Most
will sadly just have the illusion of Fools Gold, but for 30 lucky claim
owners, their bags will contain a genuine Northern California Gold nugget
of approximately 1 g. and worth significantly more than the cost of
registration of their claim.


Hotel News

2. Important information for Debit Cards users

Earlier this year there was some confusion about Hotel Incidental Room
Charges. We are restating that information here to help make sure everyone
knows what to expect.

This is NOT not a charge, it's a pre-authorization request in the amount
of $100 for incidental costs or damage and it is a one time request, not
cumulative. The hotel requests from your credit card company that if they
need to, that they can charge the $100 in case you damage the hotel, make
long distance phone calls, watch a pay movie, etc.

When you use a normal credit card upon check-in. this pre-authorization
normally expires approximately 7-10 days after you check out. However,
when you use a debit card to check in, it MAY appear that that $100 is not
available to you in cash until the charge eventually clears after con.
This is the way almost all hotels operate.

We would suggest that you do not use a debit card to check-in to your
hotel room or any hotel room unless you absolutely have too. When you use
a credit card you have additional legal protections that do not apply to
debit cards.  If you do have to use one be sure to check with your bank
beforehand to know how they handle that type of pre-authorization with
debit cards.


3. Parking

Parking for FC2010 can be really cheap, or even free! This all depends on
your arrival and departure times and careful examination of the fee and
time schedules for the public parking lots.

For example, the Pavilion Parking Garage on 150 S. Second Street in San
Jose is the closest (directly across the street) and one of the cheapest
parking garages.

See <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2010/hotel/parking> for more
information.


4. Hotel Map and Surrounding Area Map

We have a map of the hotel here:
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2010/hotel/layout>

Map of the surrounding area
<http://sanjoseretail.com/pdfs/DowntownSanJoseMapMay08.pdf>


5. Hotel Door Sign and Foam Core Display Surfaces

The Fairmont does not allow signs to be attached to the doors of the
hotel. There are dealers in the Dealers Den that will happily sell you a
door hanger sign. Additionally, the con has provided eight foam-core display
surfaces that will be placed all around the hotel that can be used to
display signs for room parties, announcements, etc. Please do deface the
signs and used the blue painters tape to attach signs to the foam core
boards.


6. Fairmont Restaurant Discount Card

At check-in, the hotel will be distributing discount cards for the
Fountain and Pagoda restaurants in the hotel. If there are multiple people
staying in the room, please ask for one card per guest. The discounts at
these two restaurants are:

20% for breakfast
20% for lunch
10% for dinner

Cards must be redeemed with your bill on a single-person basis, meaning
you do not get 20% off the table's total bill, only for the cardholder.
The easiest way to make this simple is to request separate bills for
everyone at the table, then each person use their card for their bill.
Might be a little clunky, but hey, it's a discount.

Eat up! Very Happy


7. Star Trek at TheTech - Discount

This winter Furry Star Trek fans can bask in the awe of fan geekery to the
extreme with Furries on one side of the street and all that is Trekkie on
the other.

TheTech Museum of Innovation in San Jose has extended attendees of Further
Confusion a discount of at least 20% on tickets to TheTech when purchased
online.

TheTech is located directly across the street from the beautiful Fairmont
Hotel in San Jose.

To purchase tickets with the FurCon discount you must register with
TheTech Museum online at:

<http://tickets.thetech.org/account/>

Enter Promo Code - FURCON

PLEASE NOTE: No masks or Fursuit Heads are to be worn at TheTech for
safety and other reasons. (Yes, we asked. They said no.)

Thank you for your assimilation.

myFurCon allows you to sign up for a free account and with that account
you can:

- Have access to the Further Confusion Schedule, as the myFurCon site pulls
	the info for the events from our events server. So this site, along with

conventions can be shared with any interested parties and organizations. We
anticipate expanding this program to other groups and sites in future
years. If your group is interested in helping with that project, please
contact FC via its regular course of contact.

made or any information we need to delivered will be posted to our
Twitter account.

<http://twitter.com/furcon>

In addition, such information will be posted at the Info Desk


10. Laptop Warning!

Please remember that Hotel Wireless Access Points are often prime
territory for Security Issues. If you are traveling with a laptop or PC,
please be sure to turn off all shares and minimize security risks to
protect yourself and your property.

Furthermore, if traveling internationally with a laptop of other
electronic mass storage device, please be aware that Customs and Homeland

Also, the hotel is providing free Wi-Fi access on the Second Floor where

23. Avoid the Flu!

With flu season upon us, your chances of getting sick this winter are
pretty good. To help you combat various bugs, here's information and FAQs:

<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/>

The Centers for Disease Control recommends washing your hands often with
soap and water, as well as covering your mouth when coughing and sneezing,
as effective ways to prevent the spread of the disease.

We'll have hand sanitizer stations around the con as well but the best
thing you can do is stay fed, stay rested, and stay alert. Take care of
yourself...and take care of others if they are ill. We are a community, so
lets act like it.

If you need medical attention, you should either report to Con-Ops or Flare
and they can help you get to local medical needs.

Many thanks and best wishes for a happy healthy convention.

In-Reply-To: <5214be141001301227i51ac36by5b75f2ba313aa1a7@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <OMEIJPJAFKIANLCOEJOIKEAOJNAA.marcwolf@marcwolf.org>

Hi Folks

I have an issue re some of the fur fabric I am working with. The plush is
quite long so I hope what I am suggesting will work.

The fur is glued onto the backing which soes not have much stretch to it.
What I am wondering if people can offer advice.

I have several solutions - all varing in complexity.

1. Glue (sew) thin strips of the fur fabric onto lycra, position in a way
where the stretch will not reviel the underlying lycra. This will work well
where the stretch direction will follow the lay of the fur.

2. Dissolve the fur binding glue with acetone and re glue it onto a silicone
or similar backing - this will allow stretching in both directions.

3. Fur punching onto silicone - very labor intensive.

Any other suggestions folks.

An examample of what I need this for is the fur on the skull around the
movable ears. So when the ear swivel back the fur can stretch easily.

Many thanks

Well one thing to remember is that most kinds of fake fur are really
stringey melted plastic (try hitting a scrap piece with a heat gun, you'll
see).  Honestly the best result is going to be fur punching.  You can try
affixing it to lycra but when the seam moves it will be visible, and
anything you want to stretch must be pre-stretched when you sew it,
otherwise the fur its self will prevent the stretch.  I don't think regluing
the fur is going to work.  Two scenarios:  One, the glue will prevent
stretch.  Two, the stretching action will tear the glue apart/off the
silicone.

Sorta catchy, though unfortunately I wasn't able to find the lyrics 
online, so I have no clue what they're saying. Anybody here speak 
Finnish? ;)

Ah, yes... Hevisaurus.

 From one of the many sites that mention them -- "Hevisaurus was a band made up 
of members from legendary band Dio and Sonata Arctica. Their goal was to record 
heavy metal for children. After an intense brainstorming session, someone 
thought of buying a bunch of dinosaur suits and the idea stuck. The music itself 
is in Finnish, but the lyrics usually deal with popular children?s stories and, 
you know, dinosaurs. Because that?s the heart of metal."


They have a whole album, even -- Jurahevin Kuninkaat. I think it means "Kings of 
Jurassic Metal", or something like that. You can buy it from Amazon, even. I've 
also been looking for lyrics (with hopefully English translations) but have 
managed only one song so far.

I can't remember how many times I've listened to their frigging album. I can't 
understand what the heck they are singing, but it's rather catchy. I would kill 
to have a gig like that. XD

how big of a weight can the unit move if a suiter wanted to use it on a larger dragon or dino tail??

you know if you made that use tail a little shorter you could make a remote controled face hugger. it looked like one from aliens when it was on the work bench.

Hello all you performing type (or want to be performers).  Before you
know it, MFM will be here.  Now's the time to start thinking of the act
you would like to perform.  We will have the puppet stage set up, so we
will take all the acts this year.  This is in a brand new space for us,
and should be Great show this year.  We of course will have our sound
doggy on scene, so make sure the music is on a dedicated CD or usb drive
or something like that.  If there's any questions about music or
anything, just email me or send it from the MFM website.  Plan now, and
beat the rush.  Especially those that like to submit music at the last
moment.... (no names mentioned :)

The road had been long with being on the other side of the world.  The 
discovery had been important, even having world press there to cover the 
find.  The finding of the stone would change the way people thought 
about the rise of Lion Culture.  Once the full site adminstration team 
had arrived, it was back home for the lead archologist.  The plane was 
quiet for once, but it didn't help him sleeping.  He was weary, and a 
bit apprehensive.  So there he was, standing on the path up to the log 
cabin.  With one more sigh, he walked up to the door and opened it.  
"Welcome Home." was shouted by all in the room.  It just blew the canine 
back to see all his friends there.

----
That's right folks, time is approaching for the annual MFM Masquarade.  
Now is the time to think of and work on what you want to do.  It's 
always a good time, there is always a lot of talent showing itself.  
There will be the puppet stage set up as well.  Make sure that any music 
or sounds are on their own dedicated C or USB thing.  Double check the 
cd on another computer as well (had some issues last year).  There will 
be a sign up on Friday night, which helps me figure out how many acts 
there will be.  I'll have some cookies there, then the practice is on 
Sunday, then performance later in the day.

The sound echo'd around the town.  The whistle, that same whistle that 
always meant the same thing.  This time, it was different.  Well, the 
whistle wasn't different, the fox running down the street towards the 
whistle was different.  He was late, yes, that's what the whistle meant, 
he was late.  As he rounded the corner, he could see it.  The boat was 
slowly back paddling away from the shore.  He cried out, and fortunatly 
the deck workers noticed him and didn't fully raise the gang plank.  
There was a few shaken hands between them as the fox got closer and 
closer.  He took the pack off his back and tossed it, hitting the ramp 
as with practice.  He then jumped himself, arms flailing.  There was 
much discussion on the deck of the boat, until the fox pulled himself up 
on the ramp.  Some coins changed hands as one of the gentleman stepped 
forward to the fox.  "Someday, You won't make it."  The boats whistle 
chimed off again as the mighty ship started down the lazy river.  "But 
you made it this time, welcome home." The deckhand patted the fox on the 
back and lead him towards the interior.
---

That's right, time is approaching for those immortal words, "Welcome 
Home."  Of course with thoughts of MFM coming up, the famous Masquarde 
is also approaching.  Time is shorter than you might think, so make sure 
you are planning and preparing for the excellent acts that always grace 
our stage.  Of course, our sound doggy would like to remind you that you 
should bring a CD or USB thing with only your song on it.  Double check 
your song on a different source than you recorded it on to make sure it 
works regardless.  I will have the sign up on Friday night, and would 
like to know what acts are being planned.  Sunday is practice then the 
performance.  The theme of this year is Southern Hospitality.

CALLING ALL GOPHERS!

 

We need YOU to make this convention a success!

With your help, Morphicon in the past years has been a smooth, easy going
convention, with lots of fun and very little in-con drama!

If you volunteer this year, we can help keep it that way!

 

All gophers enjoy complimentary food from our hospitality suite, lovely
hotel hallways, plenty of socialization, as well as their hours counting
towards a discounted or even comped registration for the next year!

 

Come join the fun!  It's even BETTER if you pre-register as a gopher (must
complete a certain number of service hours).  No hints yet, but believe me,
it's BETTER.

 

Please answer back to gophers at morphicon.org

Message-ID: <u2p3074b3001005061704r951cab7es3dd6fe907531aacc@mail.gmail.com>

Digitigrade leg stilts have been discussed on and off on this and other
lists for years.  Many of you have come up with your own designs.  Some are
illusions, some are plantigrade stilts, some are digitigrade stilts.

As many of you may already know, Kim Graham designed a pair and displayed
them last year on YouTube.  She was swamped with requests for them, more
than she could handle.  Ultimately she hooked up with the folks at WETA, a
prop & model shop much like ILM, based out of New Zealand.  You may have
heard of them, as they had a hand in the recent Avatar movie.

Anyhow, WETA now has the legs for sale as of a week or two ago, and is
currently selling them with an Early Bird discount good until 5/25 ($150
off, which just about covers shipping to the USA).  They are not for
everyone -- not only are they expensive ($795 with the discount), but they
are presently designed only for certain body types.  They pitch it as 80%
coverage, but I'm thinking it's more along the lines of 3/4 or maybe 2/3 of
the fursuiting population.  If you're curious whether you "fit", I strongly
encourage you to read the instruction manual available at the product web
page below.  There they detail the difference between the 'small' and
'large' sized legs.

Here's the link:
http://wetanz.com/wetalegs

I have ordered a pair for myself, to be used toward the construction of a
dragon costume that I may outsource parts of (my skills in costume building
are weakest from the waist up).  If there is enough interest, I'd be happy
to post here with observations and details and videos even.  But they
advertise a 60-day turn-around time, as they are built to order, so it'll be
a while yet.

Cheers,
--Rooth

That'd be awesome to make claws and teeth and noses and eyes out of, I could

When that is being sold again, I'd be curious to buy a small bit to test it.

Hi Rooth

I have seen them as well.  Beautiful units, Kim as a very talented designer
and artist.  Ah  for $600 in the bank right now.  I am sure that Wepa will
be swamped with orders too so hopefully they can shorten the manufacturing
time.

Thanks for the update on this.

  Digitigrade leg stilts have been discussed on and off on this and other
lists for years.  Many of you have come up with your own designs.  Some are
illusions, some are plantigrade stilts, some are digitigrade stilts.

  As many of you may already know, Kim Graham designed a pair and displayed
them last year on YouTube.  She was swamped with requests for them, more
than she could handle.  Ultimately she hooked up with the folks at WETA, a
prop & model shop much like ILM, based out of New Zealand.  You may have
heard of them, as they had a hand in the recent Avatar movie.

  Anyhow, WETA now has the legs for sale as of a week or two ago, and is
currently selling them with an Early Bird discount good until 5/25 ($150
off, which just about covers shipping to the USA).  They are not for
everyone -- not only are they expensive ($795 with the discount), but they
are presently designed only for certain body types.  They pitch it as 80%
coverage, but I'm thinking it's more along the lines of 3/4 or maybe 2/3 of
the fursuiting population.  If you're curious whether you "fit", I strongly
encourage you to read the instruction manual available at the product web
page below.  There they detail the difference between the 'small' and
'large' sized legs.

  Here's the link:
  http://wetanz.com/wetalegs

  I have ordered a pair for myself, to be used toward the construction of a
dragon costume that I may outsource parts of (my skills in costume building
are weakest from the waist up).  If there is enough interest, I'd be happy
to post here with observations and details and videos even.  But they
advertise a 60-day turn-around time, as they are built to order, so it'll be
a while yet.

  Cheers,
  --Rooth

Message-ID: <4BF4B9E8.7000800@cpl.net>

(Forwarded for Super_Jayhawk)

Hi everyone,

Some of you may have heard the announcement we made on LJ and Twitter...
Furry Night Live is hitting the road and putting on a show at Califur
2010 in just two and a half more weeks!   Since Califur's theme is
cartoons/comics, we're going to call our show....


       ....Furry Night Live Presents...

                       ....Rock N' Roll Toons!

Check out http://www.furrynightlive.org for details!  We're excited to
bring our ensemble of skit comedy, music, awards and cash prizes to a
new audience at Califur!  If you were thinking of Califur but didn't
have a reason to go, come see our show and join in the fun!

A Call For Performers
---------------------

To make a truly great show, we need great performers!   We have a number
of skits that we're wokring on that we have open roles for, abd if
you're interested in putting on your suit and joining us on stage,
please let us know! Or if you have a skit you'd like to do or are
working on, we'd love to hear from you!

And even if you don't have a fursuit but would like to help out, we need
ninjas, backstage helpers and stunt doubles to help make this show a blast!

We'll be travelling to Irvine this coming Saturday, May 22 to visit the
Irvine Marriott, the same hotel that califur will be at just two weeks
later!  If you're interested please contact us at
furrynightlive at gmail.com <mailto:furrynightlive at gmail.com> or
@furrynightlive on Twitter!

Players in the show will get a poster like the one shown on the website
in appreciation for their help, and an invite to the FNL Fast Party
where we'll be watching the playback of our show afterwards!

Not only that, but the audience will be voting for the winning acts,
which will receive awards and cash prizes, just like Furry Night Live
back in the day!

Furry Night Live will be playing one night only, Saturday at 4:00pm
before the Cabaret!  No additional tickets (other than your con badge)
are required to get in, so come see the show and rock out with us!

                                                               Thanks,

                                                               -SJ

I just got back from watching the latest Shrek movie. I showed up wearing
Donkey my unrelated donkey fursuit. It was so cool that management did not
ask me to leave. I got a couple of hugs from some of the children that where
there and a photo or two where taken of me.

I was expecting management to ask me to leave. I told my handler that if we
are asked to leave that will do so with out complaint.

That is not completely true, I have talked to some theaters that said that
having peoples faces covered with a mask is out of the question. The one we
went to I did not ask to do it before hand.

I would have loved to wear my Tenderheart Bear costume to the "Care 
Bears To The Rescue Movie" the day following we had the Care Bears in 
the DooDah Parade (NJ) but that unfortunately would not have been a 
good idea.

trick is to call ahead and know your local theater. most of the big chain ones the manager has to follow there corp guild lines or lose his job if the home office found out he broke some corp rule. the smaller family owned and drive through that are still open are more family friendly. same would go for fursuit bowling as i done it a few times with groups of furs here in mass. the trick was to call ahead. I felt sorry for the easter bunny that showed up for a kids birthday party last time i went there was one dragon and a few wolves bowling...kids thaought we were going to eat him..

Well, so far I've suited at AMC theaters (also Loews before the merger) and Marcus theaters.  That's a fairly major percentage of nationwide theaters.  Also Classic Cinemas said it was fine but we didn't go there.

Of the theater I work for my boss is fine with people dressing up for movies, especially us as the employees dressing up on Halloween.... but employees can't wear masks on the job on halloween, but I have done it on my day off on that day =3.

Due to insufficient orders for this product, the production line has been
shutdown before it really started.  I have received a refund for my
purchase, though no action was required on my part.

Guess it's back to the drawing board. ;)  At least the videos will prove
useful for motion and mechanics study.

Subject: FL: Good time to get materials for fursuit eyes
Message-ID: <894424.56008.qm@web72206.mail.tp2.yahoo.com>

Hi all:

It's about 4th of July again, super markets like wal-mart and other markets started to put out red white and blue merchandise on shelf
This is a pretty good time to stock up the white bowls or cups (or even containers) for fursuit eyes, it's about like dollar or two each. Every time visit super market I usually would stop by kitchen ware and container section to look for such material, but the container are mainly the see through ones.

It's getting harder to find this kind plastic container for eyes I think, the only materials that are about the same are water buckets or trash can, or bleach bottle (usually the bleach bottle is much softer and I am not sure if it would be strong enough to put on the eyes), but the 4th of July containers are cheaper than buckets or trash cans :)

If anyone is looking for such material for your eyes, I think it's very good time to get some right now, and of course there are many other different ways and materials you can use on the eyes.

Hops it's somewhat useful

Very sorry to hear that.
The price was high considering the market they were pushing to.  Other movie
houses (like the one that did Underworld) have the resources to do their
own, so it only left the hobby market.

In a way the price also reflected the mismatch between a hobby and a
profession.  My own suit was seen by some professionals in the movie area
and they said that for them to even start to do something like that it would
be atleast $10,000.  I am sure that many of the fursuiters here know that
cost of their own costumes is FAR below that.

It was a niche market at best and they overpriced themselves out of it.

I feel very sorry for  Kim Graham as she put a lot of time and effort into
designing them.

Take Care

  Due to insufficient orders for this product, the production line has been

purchase, though no action was required on my part.

  Guess it's back to the drawing board. ;)  At least the videos will prove

I'm sure those who want digi legs could brainstorm a method of construction and someone could stand up and supply this niche market.

 

 

Hell, I've waited 6 years to get my studio up and going. Marc, you know how long I've been around here for. I think it was back in 2001 when I first joined the list and still haven't made a complete suit for myself even having spent nearly $20,000 on spray booths, vac table and roto casting equiptment and so on. Everyting is easy once you know how!

Yes, but even big software houses sometimes buy off-the-shelf products.  The
make vs. buy decision is still made no matter how much 'make' the company is
capable of itself.  I'm sure if Underworld needed 30 of these things, WETA
could do it cheaper than Underworld could make them itself, and they'd have
plenty of good features.

In any case, hobbyists weren't their primary audience, or else they would
have been hitting conventions and adverts on relevant sites.

Agreed.  IMO, made the $795 or so for the skeleton  was pretty reasonable,
even given the 'low' price of fursuit costumes in the $2k-$5k range.

I think at this point they'd still be willing to do custom builds for folks,
but I'm sure the price would be much higher.

I?ve always had good luck using old containers as there?s always a great selection of colours available.

 

Car wax bottles

Antifreeze bottles

Dish soap bottles

Motor oil bottles

 

You just want to make sure they are washed super well before using them, as you don?t want to get some of that stuff too close to where you are wearing it, and try to pick containers that aren?t too overly shaped.  As an alternative, rubber foam works really well too, and only costs about a $1.50 a sheet and is easier to work with than plastic.

 

Just some other ideas.

Hi Folks

As many of you are aware I have been persuing some fairly advanced technical
development.  It was to be my goal of putting these into my existing
character Marcwolf... However I have decided to create a new suit to house
them and keep Marcwolf as the original.

The new suit will be an Artic Wolf, and thus using white fur of dirrerent
length gives me a lot of room to work with re textures. I have not named him
yet but wish me luck in his.. birth???

I'll keep folks updated with his progress.

Marc

4. Guests of Honor for FC2011
5. Annual Further Confusion Camp-out and Picnic
6. Events
7. Dealers Room and Furry Market Place

1. Convention Dates Changed

The dates for our 2011 convention have changed. We now have the Martin
Luther King holiday (U.S.) weekend dates of January 13 - 17. Please be sure
your travel, hotel reservations dates, and vacation requests match up with
our new dates.


2. Hotel News

We have run out of rooms on Sunday and Monday, but expect to have more
available today.  If your reservation is refused, please try again after a
short wait.


3. Themed website launch

Our themed website for Further Confusion 2011 has arrived! Many thanks go
to Krahnos for the design and artwork that gives our website a strong
anchoring within this year's theme of "Southern Crossings".


4. Guests of Honor for FC2011

Our first Guest of Honor for Further Confusion 2011 for this year's
festivities, as announced at the end of the FC2010 variety show, is the
awesome art team of Blotch. You can find their art and other information
about them at <http://www.blotchinc.com/>.

Our second Guest of Honor is Paul Kidd, who has been active within furry
fandom since its earliest days. He is the author of such furry novels as
Fangs of K'aath, Mus of Kerbridge, to name just a couple. Paul has most
recently been working as a scripter and producer in the film industry. His
scripting credits include work for Eric Idle, Jon Pertwee and Tony
Robbinson. He is currently engaged as a producer with the Hollywood EPIC
film fund - which will hopefully lead to getting his own feature films and
TV series out in the near future. Plus, he's from Australia - which is just
perfect, given our theme this year.


5. Annual Further Confusion Camp-out and Picnic

We are currently making plans for the FC2011 Camp-out, which will take
place on the nights of Friday September 10th and Saturday September 11th.
Watch for further announcements about location and sign ups soon.

The annual Further Confusion picnic will be held Saturday, September 11th.
Again, watch for more detailed announcement coming shortly.

The picnic is free and open to all - no RSVP required!


6. Events

Now is the time of year when we are recruiting for panels. We have several
tracks of presentations including: Art, Writing, Fursuiting,
Science/Technology, Puppetry, Gaming, Social, Species, Music, and
Spirituality. Please put your requests in early to have a better chance of
being scheduled. If you have something that you find interesting and is
related to furry fandom, email us at events at furtherconfusion.org


7. Dealers Room and Furry Market Place

Dealers Room Sold Out - Waiting List has begun

Yes, it's that time of year again, the Further Confusion Dealer Room has
sold out. So, if you are interested in getting a table in the Dealer Room,
the only way will be to submit a Waiting List Application. This application
is available as a PDF on the dealer page of the Further Confusion website.
Just print it out, fill out and send in the last 2 pages, and you'll be in
the lottery for a table when/if one becomes available.

Furry Market Place spaces go on sale August 1st, 2010

Even though the Dealer Room is sold out, the 20 spaces in the Furry Market
Place have not even been offered yet. But they WILL be. They start on sale
for US$75 (which includes one full membership to the convention) starting
August 1st.

If you are interested in one of these spaces, watch for the Furry Market
Place page on the Further Confusion website in early July. The application
for purchase of a Furry Market Place space will appear there, in PDF form.
For FULL details, including the limitations of the Furry Market Place (No
Adult material and you have to set up and tear down each day) see the
Further Confusion website's Furry Market place page when it goes live in
July.

So, watch the skies... er, the website, for the Furry Market Place
applications in July. And again, there will only be 20 spaces available and
when they are sold out, they are sold out.


8. Next Staff Meeting

Our next staff meeting will be on July 17th, starting at 1:00pm in the San
Jose Fairmont. Check the lobby electronic sign for our room assignment.
Parking is available in the surrounding area but is not free. The parking
lot closest to the hotel will run $7 for the duration of the meeting.

Message-ID: <753102.94925.qm@web50302.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Not for a fursuit, but it is a mold making question that folks on the list may encounter in suit creation.

So I need to make a couple of foam rubber watermelons for a project.  I've made small plaster two-part molds before by simply putting the object in a box and pouring all around it in two stages.  However, watermelons are rather large, and I really don't want to go that route.  I could try and make a reinforced shell using plaster and plaster bandages, but I'm not certain how to make that edge between the two halves.  Any advice?

The way I typically see such large molds made is with dental alginate.  You
get roughly a half inch to 1 inch thick coating on the object and then
support that with plaster.  Though it's been a while since I've seen this
done.  It was on an episode of Mythbusters but I've seen it all over the
internet too.  Look for a tutorial on life casting; it's the same process.

What is your budget for the project?  When you say foam are you talking
about a rigid or soft foam?  .  If you just need watermelon props there may
be other ways to do it if foam is not needed. I went to school for this type
of stuff.  Just need a little more detail and I can shoot out some ideas.

Soft foam.  I need to stuff several of them into a large puppet's mouth.

Budget... I'd rather not spend a lot.  In my favor I have a ton of plaster from earlier projects, and a quart of 4 lb expanding soft foam.

I've thought about painting children's Nerf balls for cantaloupes, but I don't know of anything that would be an oblong watermelon shape.

Current plan conceived last night is to stuff a watermelon halfway through a hole in a piece of cardboard to create a barrier upon which I can mount mold keys and support half of a plaster shell.  When that dries, remove the cardboard, invert, and cast the other half.  I think that would work.

If you use mold release and/or petroleum jelly on the plaster, you can do
the top half with the bottom half still attached.  This is how I tend to do
molds.

Alternatively, depending on just how exact these molds need to be, you could
simply put the foam inside a balloon perhaps.  Though this would work best
with expanding foam that comes out of some sort of injector.

I don't know if they will be large enough, but a Nerf football is an
oblong shape.  You could make it a little more round by trimming the
pointy ends a bit.

If anyone is planing to go to Further Confusion 2011 and can't pay the hotel
for the 4 nights. I have a room in the hotel. I think the room's type is
Deluxe, its really big.

I know that the price for the standard rooms were around $123 per night.
They are all out.

If I can find at least 4 people willing to pay $275.00 USD each, that will
cover the price for the room totally, or maybe more people can join us, so
each one will need less money. That will cover the room for 4 nights. So
each night will cost you $68.00 USD. or less if more people comes.

If you are interested please let me know. But I will need to be 100% sure
you will go.

Total amount for the room -> $1100.00 USD (Deluxe Room - It's really big!!!)

2 people = $550.00 USD each
3 people = $337.00 USD each
4 people = $275.00 USD each (minimun)
5 people = $220.00 USD each
6 people = $184.00 USD each
7 people = $158.00 USD each
8 people = $138.00 USD each
9 people = $122.00 USD each
10 people = $110.00 USD each

email address:    dmilesfox at gmail.com / v.dragoneye.n09 at gmail.com
messenger:         d.milesfox at hotmail.com  (don't forget the "dot" :P)

Need to find at least 4 people ASAP, or more if possible!

I don't normally recommend having more than 4 in a room. Since this room is
suite I could see possibly cramming 6 in. The cost savings gets to way to
small for a more crowed room. Is saving about $7.50 a night for having a 7th
person really worth having to deal with another person and there stuff in
the room? Having more than 4 in the room you also run the risk of the
'hotel' kicking everyone out of the room.

Totally agree with you, so I think 4 might be a good number and 6 a possible
max!

I got kicked out!  LOL

So I talked to a manager a couple weeks ago and everything was cool.   
Headed over today with a buddy and we met up with Moo Cow and Little  
Moo.  Had a super good time with them out at the Chickfila tent  
playing games and goofing around with eachother... then it all went  
very wrong when I went inside.  Since I didn't have time to "dress  
Scape up like a cow" I was just planning on 'eating' the trays and  
begging at the counter but some manager dude who seemed friendly at  
first was asking what organization I was with -I wasn't talking in  
character and my buddy was trying to explain I'm not with an  
organization -to which the guy was really upset and demanded we  
leave.  Regrouped outside at a picnic table to let my friend know the  
manager's name I'd talked to earlier on and she went back in to  
explain -no dice.  Ah well -Chickfila is still awesome -we went back  
in to eat and I just really had to avoid that guy 'cuz I was too  
weirded out by the whole experience to even say hi.

Good times though!  Got some photos coming back too of the happy  
moments.
Hope all you actual "Cows" out there had better luck than I did LOL

Glad to hear you had a good time despite the issue with that manager!

A friend and I emailed our local Chik-fil-A for permission and got turned
down. I actually did mention being part of an organization (Hi-4 in this
case - www.hi-4.org) and I think that was a persuasive bit of information,
but they explained they had put a lot of meticulous planning into the event
and wanted to make sure it was "all about the cows" and not foxes or
huskalopes or anything else. Oh well. :) But they expressed an interest in
having us come by to entertain for other charity events, so that's a huge
plus!

Just a little more patience and soon I'll have achieved my lifelong goal of
crawling around in those Chik-fil-A crawl tubes in fursuit. *laughs* It
won't be long now... XD

begging at the counter but some manager dude who seemed friendly at  
first was asking what organization I was with -I wasn't talking in  
character and my buddy was trying to explain I'm not with an  
organization -to which the guy was really upset and demanded we  
leave.  Regrouped outside at a picnic table to let my friend know the  
manager's name I'd talked to earlier on and she went back in to  
explain -no dice.  Ah well -Chickfila is still awesome -we went back  
in to eat and I just really had to avoid that guy 'cuz I was too  
weirded out by the whole experience to even say hi.

Good times though!  Got some photos coming back too of the happy  
moments.
Hope all you actual "Cows" out there had better luck than I did LOL

Yeah, it's definitely all about the cows, although I know that people
with bull costumes have successfully visited CFAs on Dress Like a Cow
day.  Any other kind of costume is most likely going to be treated like
it would be any other day of the year.

I will dare say that the chain and/or promotion is very popular here in
Atlanta (the home of Chick-Fil-A).  I never made it into the parking lot
of the first CFA I went to for lunch, as cars were lined up out in the
street trying to get in.  The second location I tried was pretty busy,
too, but I got into the lot and found a space.

My cow was a big hit with the restaurant staff, and I even got to greet
a small group of kids who I think mistook me for the official CFA cow
character.  I ate my free meal while still in the costume (I specially
designed the costume for this purpose), then went outside to look for 
the official cow so I could surprise and greet him.  He'd been waving
to people up at the edge of the road (in 98 degree heat no less - I 
didn't envy him one bit), but he had wisely gone on break and I didn't 
have time to wait around for him to come back out.

A really fun experience, and I'll likely visit another location for 
dinner tonight.  At least then I won't have to rush back to work
and can just hang out (in suit) for a while before going home.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

I'm just wondering why it seemed so hard/unreasonable for Chik-Fil-A to 
require people to show up in a -cow- suit and not some other species of 
fursuit? The manager who told you your non-cow/bull suit wasn't eligible for 
the free food was completely right, unless I misunderstood you. Fursuiting 
is not a free pass, no matter how cute or realistic your suit is. I only 
mention this because it's hard enough to go fursuiting at restaurants and 
other such places that when a place allows us to do it, not following their 
rules could make them not want to do it anymore, cutting off one more way 
for us to enjoy fursuiting around town. :/

Oh also, one more thing, PETA is known to wear fursuits and go harass 
restaurants, so having someone show up in a non-accepted fursuit could set 
off their warning bells, like when they asked you what organization you were 
with. That's another way to make them not want to let us do our thing.

I'm not sure if you're addressing this toward me or to Scape?

If the question is directed toward me then yes, you are mistaken: Before
doing something questionable on someone else's property I extended the
courtesy of asking for permission first. The request was politely denied
(though the restaurant wants to keep in touch for possible future
appearances), and that was the end of the story.

I did not argue, complain, question the decision, claim that this person was
wrong, or appear anyway. I did nothing of that sort on this list or off of
it. I did not even think about appearing after that point. I respected the
decision and followed the rules, just as I would expect every other
respectable person, fursuiter or not, to do. 

I merely mentioned it in response to Scape's experience, in which he was
-granted- permission beforehand, but asked to leave anyway. It sounds like
he complied with the request, as frustrating as it was, and I believe he
made the right choice.

yeah I talked with one manager ahead of time and a different one  
kicked me out.  I hung out with the "cows" afterward and they were  
all stoked about the visit -they actually frequent a studio I work at  
for local commercials and had heard about "the goat" before so they  
were glad to meet him ^^
Yeah bummer of a moment after such a happy moment but -I mean, it  
happens all the time in fursuiting -there are just going to be people  
out there that don't dig it -my undiggable time today just happened  
to be fairly epic fail hahhaha
ah well

I just got back from an hour drive each way to go to the closes Chick Fil-A
to me. I had a blast wearing B.S. Bullatauras in the restraint . I did have
a big worry. The restraint was inside an enclosed major national mall and
such malls are well known for being anti masked people. I sent in my handler
to find the restraint inside the mall wail I sat in the car. He found the
fastest way in so I can get into the restraint before the mall security
could kick me out. I spent some time inside the restraint having lots of
people including I think everyone that worked there have there photo taken
with me. When I was ready to leave I left as quickly as I could.

One of the employees made the comment that she thought that my costume was a
great deal better than the one that they had. I have seen the costume in
photos and I could not have agreed more. Also I was asked where I bought my
costume. The person was floored when my handler said that I made it my self.

You can find two of the photos here http://www.furaffinity.net/user/donkey/

Hey all, 


I'm playing the TInman in an upcoming "Wizard of Oz" show and I'm looking for ideas for how to create a costume. 


The main thing is the torso piece looking "tincanish", big and cylindrical and stiff, yet movable. And I do have a couple of falls in the show so it has to be made of stuff that won't hurt me when I fall onto it. 


.Any tips or hints for this? 


Thanks

How about using one of those giant heavy paperboard forms used  for  
casting cement pillars? A construction comapny near you might have a leftover  odd 
piece or two your size . . .
 
Good luck -

Hey all,  


I'm playing the TInman in an upcoming "Wizard of Oz" show and I'm looking  
for ideas for how to create a costume.


The main thing is the torso piece looking "tincanish", big and  cylindrical 
and stiff, yet movable. And I do have a couple of falls in the  show so it 
has to be made of stuff that won't hurt me when I fall onto  it.


.Any tips or hints for this?


Thanks

Nice costume, Donkey! I can see why they would be impressed. :) To the other guys, I didn't mean to offend. The story seemed a bit chopped as I didn't remember seeing the part about permission from one and denial from the other, being explained very well. Sounds like everyone did their best to be positive and have a good time. Sorry it didn't work out as well as it should've.

I just got back from an hour drive each way to go to the closes Chick Fil-A to me. I had a blast wearing B.S. Bullatauras in the restraint . I did have a big worry. The restraint was inside an enclosed major national mall and such malls are well known for being anti masked people. I sent in my handler to find the restraint inside the mall wail I sat in the car. He found the fastest way in so I can get into the restraint before the mall security could kick me out. I spent some time inside the restraint having lots of people including I think everyone that worked there have there photo taken with me. When I was ready to leave I left as quickly as I could. 


One of the employees made the comment that she thought that my costume 
was a great deal better than the one that they had. I have seen the 
costume in photos and I could not have agreed more. Also I was asked where I bought my costume. The person was floored when my handler said that I made it my self.

You can find two of the photos here http://www.furaffinity.net/user/donkey/

Has anyone ever considered setting up a Fursuit Soccer League at a con? A simple 5-a-side Tournament could be done in a large room. It would just need some cheap goals, from a Sports Shop, and an large inflatable soccer ball. A real one would be too dangerous and too small to play with in Fursuits.

I think it could work quite well. International games like UK vs USA, France vs Germany etc would certainly be fun.

Try Googling "Tin Man Costume"
?
There are holoween level costumes for sale and instructions on how to build your own.
?
Find out what theatre groups have done "The Wizard of Oz" in say, the last five years.? They may have a costume they have no need of.? They would have good leads on where to find one.? (That's how most theatre groups operate due to limited time and money.? I can't tell you how many times "Little Shop of Horrors" was produced using the same plant puppets.)

Nice idea, but it would not work at most fur cons because of the lack of
space. The only fur con that I have been to that could pull that off inside
would be AC. It could be done out side if there was a park very close to the
hotel.

Its totally shameful and humiliating that my spelling is so bad that I never
realized that I used the wrong word. If it was not for the spell checker no
one would have any clue what I was trying to say.

 MFM did a variation of this a few years ago during the fursuit games. 
They played Fursut foosball :)

Yes. Ouchies are part of the course with fursuiting but heat exhaustion is
not something that you want to fool around with.

5-a-side soccer has halves that are only 10 minutes long. The games would last about half an hour. 10 minutes per side, with 10 minutes at half-time.

5-a-side soccer has halves that are only 10 minutes long. The games would last about half an hour. 10 minutes per side, with 10 minutes at half-time.

  Yes. Ouchies are part of the course with fursuiting but heat exhaustion is not something that you want to fool around with.

	approaching
Message-ID: <8CCF1B8C66C8611-F24-3D51@webmail-m088.sysops.aol.com>

The August 6 signup deadline for this event is fast approaching but so 
far I haven't really heard from anybody committing to take part.  Next 
to the Ocean City NJ DooDah Parade, this is the second largest 
open-invite costume character event between the NYC area and NJ shore 
to which we have always been welcomed back at for well over a decade so 
please join up!  Details reposted below:    

*****Long Island Ducks Mascot Day - Sunday August 22 (confirmed)*******

The official invites for Quacker Jack's Mascot Day at the Long Island 
Ducks baseball game have been sent out.

The game will be the Sunday August 22 versus Newark Bears, first pitch 
shortly after 5pm. That would make call time 3pm.
The Ducks play at CitiField in Central Islip NY in Suffolk County.

The regular baseball game will be preceded by the traditional mascot 
dodgeball game.

Between innings of the regular baseball game, guest mascots will be 
taking part in some of the on-field promotions. I don't know if this 
will involve us--in past years sometimes it has, other times only the 
commercial characters took part. The rest of the game of course will be 
free open meet & greet throughout the ballpark.

RSVP's due by August 6. If you haven't participated in this event 
before, please furnish me with full contact info (RL name and phone 
#'s..required by the ballclub), name of character you're appearing as 
and any "fun facts"/interests about same that can be read by the 
announcer when we are introduced on-field. Unless anyone else 
individually requests otherwise, we are still known by them as being 
"from the Rapid T. Rabbit and Friends TV Show". For returning 
characters, I will use any information that I have on file previously 
but be sure I have updated phone numbers from everybody.

This is a major event with an excellent family audience that welcomes 
all the friendly characters that we can throw at them so please join us!

--=={ Tiger Haven Auction }==--

Tiger Haven is a safe haven for big cats. Tiger Haven rescues large cats 
such as lions, tigers, and panthers from all over the United States. These 
big cats may be anything from older circus or zoo cats, to cats that were 
obtained illegally or were neglected or abused. Once these cats have been 
rescued by Tiger Haven, they have a forever home. Tiger Haven is a no kill 
shelter that does not sell or breed their cats.

Tiger Haven started with just one cat many years ago and has grown to over 
250 big cats. All these cats require enclosures to live in, food and 
veterinary care. These costs add up and care for each cat costs thousands 
each year. Tiger Haven is a nonprofit organization, which means that they 
rely on donations from caring individuals. The auction held each year at 
Mephit Fur Meet is often the largest single contributer to Tiger Haven. 
Beyond the normal care for the big cats, the money raised at MFM has built 
multiple enclosures for Tiger Haven. These are nice enclosures that become a 
forever home for a big cat in need.

Tiger Haven is located in eastern Tennessee and usually affords MFM a couple 
of their long time workers to be with us at MFM and at the charity auction. 
This is not a nameless, faceless organization that we are blindly helping. 
These workers will happily answer any questions you have about Tiger Haven. 
These people work hard everyday to ensure these big cats have a safe and 
comfortable home for life.

Money or items donated to the charity auction held every year at MFM all go 
directly to Tiger Haven to be used to help these big cats in need. These big 
cats cannot personally thank you but their appreciation for their great care 
is seen everyday by the workers of Tiger Haven. On behalf of these big cats 
who now enjoy a safe home in the caring walls of Tiger Haven we wish to 
thank you for any help you can give.

--=={ Programming }==--

Schedule is ONLINE!!!! Check the website for details!
http://mephitfurmeet.org/2010Schedule

--=={ MFM Critter ConSuite }==--

This year's Critter ConSuite will once again have a wide variety of snackies 
for this year's attendees with the traditional Cafe Karina Bagel Breakfast 
on Saturday and Sunday.  Karina is contemplating ways of integrating this 
year's theme into both decor and food.  Suggestions will be cheerfully 
welcomed and considered.

--=={ MFM Masquerade }==--

MFM wouldn't be the same without the Masq.  Never fear though, there will be 
a Masq this year.  If you are a fursuiter or pawpetter you are invited to 
join in and present an act.  Just contact Blue Heeler SunFire
for any details or information.  It's fun and exciting.

The sound echo'd around the town.  The whistle, that same whistle that 
always meant the same thing.  This time, it was different.  Well, the 
whistle wasn't different, the fox running down the street towards the 
whistle was different.  He was late, yes, that's what the whistle meant, he 
was late.  As he rounded the corner, he could see it.  The boat was slowly 
back paddling away from the shore.  He cried out, and fortunatly the deck 
workers noticed him and didn't fully raise the gang plank.  There was a few 
shaken hands between them as the fox got closer and closer.  He took the 
pack off his back and tossed it, hitting the ramp as with practice.  He then 
jumped himself, arms flailing.  There was much discussion on the deck of the 
boat, until the fox pulled himself up on the ramp.  Some coins changed hands 
as one of the gentleman stepped forward to the fox.  "Someday, You won't 
make it."  The boats whistle chimed off again as the mighty ship started 
down the lazy river.  "But you made it this time, welcome home." The 
deckhand patted the fox on the back and lead him towards the interior.
---

That's right, time is approaching for those immortal words, "Welcome Home." 
Of course with thoughts of MFM coming up, the famous Masquerade is also 
approaching.  Time is shorter than you might think, so make sure you are 
planning and preparing for the excellent acts that always grace our stage. 
Of course, our sound doggy would like to remind you that you should bring a 
CD or USB thing with only your song on it.  Double check your song on a 
different source than you recorded it on to make sure it works regardless. 
I will have the sign up on Friday night, and would like to know what acts 
are being planned.  Sunday is practice then the performance.  The theme of 
this year is Southern Hospitality.

--=={ MFM First Aid Hints! }==--

Greetings from the land of cold weather!!

After a nice, cold, snowy winter here in Pittsburgh, I wanted to take a 
moment to remind everyone of some very important things.  We on the Medical 
staff are here to help you have a healthy and incident free con experience. 
With that in mind, we would like to remind everyone that as wild as the 
weather can be, MFM has traditionally been very hot and humid.  PLEASE drink 
plenty of water.  I know spending time in fursuit is fun and that some 
suiters see this as what they should do the entire con.  We want you all to 
have fun and enjoy yourselves, but please take advantage of the Headless 
Lounge to stop for a while and cool off and drink something.  And for our 
non suiters, feel free to drop by the con suite and grab something to drink. 
Its easy during these times to get some very serious medical problems, 
including heat exhaustion and heat stroke.  And please remember to have a 
fair sized meal during the day, your body will need all the energy it can 
get to enjoy all the fun activities that are planned.  On a personal note, i 
would like to encourage everyone who takes medication to make yourself a 
list of all your medications and allergies and keep them near your 
license/ID just in the worst case we have to have someone taken by 
ambulance.  We just want everyone to have a good time. Again, please 
remember that we are here to help you, so if you need medical assistance 
with something, find any member of staff and ask them to contact the medical 
team.  Thank you all and I hope to see you all there.  Also, the medical 
staff does not have any drugs.  We do not carry Aspirin or Tylenol or Motrin 
or Advil or Bennadryl.  If you have allergies or headaches or anything else 
you need medication for, please bring it.

On behalf of the entire staff, the medical staff would like again to welcome 
you home to our new home, Whispering Woods.  Our Medical head, Goliath, who 
has been coming to MFM since MFM 2004, and is a practicing paramedic and 
paramedic instructor, would like to announce that this year he is proud to 
have restructured the medical staff to serve you better.  He would like to 
welcome Ashley Fox and Tigeris Tiger, his assistants, and the rest of his 
staff to a new beginning and new procedures.  If you are experiencing any 
medical issues at the convention, feel free to stop by Con Ops on the 
Mezzanine level and ask for a medical staff member.  We will have a 
dedicated room to discuss things with you and try to do our best to help you 
out of public con space where everyone could crowd around you.  Also, any 
staff member can contact the medical staff, so if you're out and about and 
need a member of medical, find any staff member and ask them to contact us. 
If you have medical experience and would be interested in helping out at 
various times during the con, please come by Con Ops and talk to Goliath. 
If he isn't there when you stop by, please leave some contact information 
with either the med/security dispatcher or with any other Ops personnel and 
they will get it to him.

Goliath

--=={ MFM Security Information }==--

Your MFM Security staff is diligently preparing for our first convention in 
our new home.  You can easily recognize security staff at the convention by 
looking for the bright Animal Control Vests they wear.   Please take a 
moment to read our code of conduct, and ask for clarification on any rule 
you are unsure of. This is going to be our BEST year yet, and your Security 
staff will be there keeping watch.

Even though we have moved to an area with a substantially lower crime rate, 
there are some basic things you can do to protect your personal belongings 
whenever you travel.   Remove all valuables from your car.  This includes 
GPS, Cell Phones, computers, and even radar detectors.  Do not have items 
out in the open to temp passersby.  Lock your doors, both car and hotel 
room, and do not leave cash or valuables out in the open in your room. 
Following these simple precautions can help make your MFM 2010 an enjoyable 
weekend.  Are you interested in working with Security at the con?  Just 
contact our Volunteer Coordinator and request security.

See you at MFM

today! 


4. Badge Art Wanted! 

Further Confusion is currently seeking artwork submissions for the 2011
membership badge inserts. Both color and black & white artwork will be
accepted, and all artwork will be considered on overall 'look and feel',
plus these additional points:

- Size: Art must scale to be printed at 4" x 2".
- Theme: Art must accurately reflect the theme of the con.
- Age appropriateness: The art must be suitable for viewing by children.

Artists submitting images should be aware that there is no payment for
badge art chosen, and the artist gives Further Confusion the right to
reproduce the image as badge art for FC2011. The artist will be credited
on the insert and in the con program book. The artist retains all other
copyrights and reproduction rights beyond the above.  Submission deadline
is November 1st, 2010. All qualifying submissions will be seriously
considered and we will choose 6 designs. All artists will be notified by
December 1st as to whether or not their submissions have been chosen.

Submission technical specs: We prefer JPG format at best possible quality
compression, at 300 DPI. An 8" by 4" original scanned at 300DPI gives us a
good file to work with. Badge art submissions should be sent to
badge-art at furtherconfusion.org . In the email specify how you wish to be
credited should your art be chosen.


5. Art Show Sales Open

The art show sales are open! If you are interested in placing a piece,
please see <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2011/artshow> for the rules
and an application form to be in the art show.


6. Dealer Room Waiting List Application on website

The Further Confusion 2011 Dealer Room may be sold out, but that does NOT
mean that there is no chance of you getting in. Usually around the end of
the year we get at least a few cancellations, and when that happens we
turn to the people that have sent in Waiting List Applications to fill
those tables emptied in that manner. We make our selection from all
applications present in the pool at the time of the cancellation. So for
you best chance, get your application in as soon as possible. But
remember, we can't make any promises that any tables will become
available. The Waiting List will stop accepting applications on December
15th, 2010.


7. Furry Market Place spaces go on sale starting August 1st

Yes, that's right, it's that time of year again. We are putting 20 Furry
Market Place spaces up for sale starting August 1st. For full information
on the limitations of this area (Like 'No Adult Material' and 'Set up and
tear down daily') as well as the application you need to fill out and send
in with payment, head over to the Further Confusion 2011 website. The
application is in PDF format. Cost of a space is US$75.00. You MUST be
at least 18 years of age, and you must have a valid CA Sales Permit (Free
- there's a link to where you get them on the website) before you start
sales on Friday of the convention.  Again, all the information is on the
website, and space IS limited. Sales will close when all 20 spaces are
sold or December 15th, 2010, whichever comes first. (Unused spaces will
either be removed from the layout or offered to our charities as
additional display space.)


8. Next Staff Meeting

Our next staff meeting will be on August 28th, starting at 1:00pm in the San
Jose Fairmont. Check the lobby electronic sign for our room assignment.
Parking is available in the surrounding area but is not free. The parking
lot closest to the hotel will run $7 for the duration of the meeting.

After talking with Robert King at Anthrocon this year, we were discussing this mailing list.

It seems that over the course of the years that the mail list started way back in the mid 90's, that mail list was the best method of transport for 
the time.  As history progressed, and technologies improved, we say better and newer technologies evolve, that soon gained more ease of use and 
popularity.  Live journal, wikipedia, furwiki, furaffinity, etc  have all evolved to be a plethora of shocase for the thousands of fursuiters that 
are now making up the furry fandom.  Far from the days of 30 or so stomping around those early days of confurence.

It was thought that maybe we should end the era of the fursuit mail list.  The traffic and information here has dwindled to a fraction of the traffic 
that are found on all those other mediums.  What was thought was perhaps to archive the entire mail list, so that it has a historical archive of all 
the stuff that was discussed over the years.  

We could then look at freezing the fursuit "FAQ" and adding that to a historical repository as well, perhaps turning all the data over to Furwiki, 
for locked down long term archiving.

We would then keep the fursuit.org domain and point that all over to the furwiki section to keep up the link.

What are all you're thoughts?

I'm all open for ideas on how we could revitalize both the website and the mail list..  but as it stands, no one is editing the wiki, so it's simply 
fizzling out.  

Maybe move the wiki to fur-wiki for more general exposure, so it can be seen by both the fursuit.org domain, as well as the general public browsing 
around on furwiki?

I think its the best idea...  I'd be curious to know when I was accepted onto the list but I can almost guarantee I'm one of the earlier ones.  I can still remember "Len's In The Fuzz" website and the good info it used to have.

There is so much info out there now that I suggest that this list be taken off of life support systems.

I have always enjoyed the good info, but for the last couple of years its been mostly spam...  I've stayed around just on the chances that something good comes along.

But I think those days are over.

Let's take a moment of silence to remember the good times.

Regards,

Sardognsca

I would say either keep the list goig for us old-timers or if the list 
does get shut down I would recommend archiving the history and making it 
publicly accessible.  Keeping stuff like the archive is good for 
historical purposes.  I still remember Len's "In The Fuzz" page and when 
you had to apply to R. C. King to get on the list in which it usually 
took a week to find out if you were accepted or not.

I agree.

Another good thing about fursuit.org it has less drama. The owners of
the other sites ether don't discourage drama or create it. On LJ I
posted a photo of a fursuit head that was just me trying out a new way
of making heads, and I received nothing but ridicule and insults, and
the owner participated in it also. As you could guess I left and have
no plans to ever return. Let the click wannabees have there web pages
please let the adults keep fursuit.org

There are sometimes useful threads on the mailing list but they are few and far between. 
I think a section on the wiki would be a bit better.

Agreed with Sardognsca.  I'm mostly here "just in case" something special should come through here and not other channels...but, truthfully, it's been years since that's happened, and I'd been considering unsubscribing anyway just to do away with the monthly reminders in my mailbox.

Hey, things change, modes of communication change.  Better to see the book closed on your own terms than have it fizzle into obscurity and denial.  It's been a good ride, and I'm exceedingly grateful for all I've learned here, but I don't think it's necessary to beat a dead pantomime horse just for old time's sake.

If the list is retired, I would suggest keeping a very simple auto responder in its place so that any incoming subscription requests or would-be posts receive a note regarding other online resources (including the list archive, if implemented).  There's probably a lot of sites and Google cachery out there that still mention the list as a resource, and this would be a good way to keep newcomers in the loop instead of just a dead mail bounce.

The better idea is to pull this out and look at what function this
Listserv is still supporting. Then look at what can be put up in it's
place.

Let's start with function. And feel free to add to any of my lists,
please.

The strengths:
1) It's history. The logs of this Listserv serve as a marker of where
we've been and where we are.
2) It's social.
3) It's low bandwidth. Listservs are text.

The problems:
1) The fandom has grown. Maybe e-mail isn't the best way of reaching
everyone, for whatever reason.
2) It's easy to miss. Many new fursuiters don't even know how to *use* a
Listserv.

How is a web site better? Well... it isn't. The functioning of a Listserv
really isn't better than a web site with forums/blogging/accounts. It's
just shinier. As for newbies not knowing how to *use* a Listserv, we all
had to start somewhere.

That leaves us with a purely technical set of questions:

1) Is the Listserv software still being maintained?
2) Are there alternatives that will if the software is not.

What I'm getting at from a technical point of view: Is there a reason to
put in an in-like replacement.

And finally, what about expansion? Can we so an LJ/Facebook/Twitter echo
to the Listserv? The idea here is that the Listserv stays in place, but the
traffic is automatically copied (minus some admin commands that keep this
from happening) to your blog platform (or web site) and announcements of
updates are posted to Twitter. Then people can drop the e-mail feed,
subscribe to Twitter (if that works better for them), and post their
reactions to the web site/blog. You either have a Listserv account, a
blog/forum account, or both. You can even echo RT/@ responses from Twitter
to the list.

My point here is maybe we shouldn't "kill" the Listserv, but expand it
into something that makes a better use of the available technologies while
still leaving what works well alone.

Just a thought.

I think a small web forum would be a great replacement.  PhpBB is easy to set up and comes with most hosting packages.

Another good one also... There's so many trolls and lowlifes out there who 
can easily overwhelm a post you made with stupid and/or snide comments, 
people who "diarrhea comment," ad posters, and as Donkey said, post 
ridicule and insults.

This list can also be used to point to other interesting posts and sites 
related to suiting and start discussing it here or there. This has been 
one of the cleanest I've been on, despite its age.

I've not been able to do much work on the FursuitWiki (or FAQ) and my 
suiting/makeup what with my returning to school and dealing with surgery 
on both knees. I'm wondering if there's a list or something for those who 
want to find ways to include their cane, walker, wheelchair, crutches, 
etc, with their suiting endeavours? A tail draped over one's shoulder 
while using a wheelchair comes to mind.

One oddball thing comes to mind... A renfest-friendly suit, and you're 
using an electric scooter outfitted with a dragon head on the front, tail 
in back, the "ears" steer the thing, and the sides are dragon scales. I'm 
wondering if anyone's done similar with manual wheelchairs and canes?

Hmm... Crutches/canes made to look like walking sticks...

I wouldn't mind so much, as long as the wiki was OPEN to modify, in case
we find a great new fur seller, a great new way of making fursuits, etc...

I am happy with the way LJ Fursuit is running, but it will be sad to lose
a mailing list I have been on for 10 years. Though I do understand. 
Hardly any of it has to do with fursuiting anymore.

Thanks for your hard work over the years!

Mainly, I ended up remaining on the list because of the occasional con
newsletter - and there's many other (better?) ways to get those.

The list as a source of creative inspiration / advice / building ...
really hasn't existed very well for me since I joined it. I did much
of my building based on other sources. An archive would be interesting
though. I really enjoy telling stories about eras of fursuit building
- even my most amateur attempts would have been at home in 199X, and
it's sometimes fun to see the tech in building over the years.

I remember wise words that came out of here a while ago...  If you don't like something, just hit the delete key.  

It really is sad that I spend way more time deleting stuff than is actually prudent.

That being said, Livejournal info is sooo accesible you wonder what people are thinking when they post...  I recently posted a suit for sale, and, had a response back "Nice suit, but I want a white one" and another saying "its the wrong time"...  Also had an email asking me if I'd hold on to the suit and sell it to them later.

I also was looking at the Fursuit Lounge site and wonder when it became the fursuit video site, as a lot of people have started posting vids of them dancing around..  I could see it being relevant if they had asked about performance... But dancing around for the fun of it doesn't seem on topic...

Who knows.

That being said, I think this could be re-worked to being useful, but, wonder if people want to invest the time.

It's time for it to go I think.  It's been years really since I've read
anything overly useful on the list, and I feel I am one of the 'old timers'
on here.  I think starting a website with a web forum, attached to the
domain might be a good idea, this way posts from this list could be stored
there in maybe a searchable archive.  It would be even better if something
could be setup so there would be closed, invite only/approved only forum for
those that can prove they have made a suit, or maybe another that can be
related to performance as well (those who have performed at a public event,
or something to that like).  For those that do not meet those types of
criteria, a separate forum could be there for the general banter (that I
really do not care about)

There were many useful articles and posts in the past, but I really think
those days have come to an end, seeing as the majority of folks these days
just pay someone to make them a suit, rather than trying to be adventurous
and making one themselves, the purpose of this list has really vanished.

I think it had a good run, but all things come to an end, and I really think
it's time.

I recently closed off a site I've been keeping online for the last 15 years.
It was hard to pull the plug, but with very few hits, and little relevancy
or lack of interest in its content it was time.  Same goes for this list.

After talking with Robert King at Anthrocon this year, we were discussing
this mailing list.

It seems that over the course of the years that the mail list started way
back in the mid 90's, that mail list was the best method of transport for 
the time.  As history progressed, and technologies improved, we say better
and newer technologies evolve, that soon gained more ease of use and 
popularity.  Live journal, wikipedia, furwiki, furaffinity, etc  have all
evolved to be a plethora of shocase for the thousands of fursuiters that 
are now making up the furry fandom.  Far from the days of 30 or so stomping
around those early days of confurence.

It was thought that maybe we should end the era of the fursuit mail list.
The traffic and information here has dwindled to a fraction of the traffic 
that are found on all those other mediums.  What was thought was perhaps to
archive the entire mail list, so that it has a historical archive of all 
the stuff that was discussed over the years.  

We could then look at freezing the fursuit "FAQ" and adding that to a
historical repository as well, perhaps turning all the data over to Furwiki,

for locked down long term archiving.

We would then keep the fursuit.org domain and point that all over to the
furwiki section to keep up the link.

What are all you're thoughts?

I like the news list as it gives me a propmt when there is something on.   
I really suffer from information overload with my work as a programmer, IT 
Admin, SPFX amature, etc etc etc

it gets to the point where there are so many forums that I am registered on 
(and need to be on for various questions etc) that loggin into each one on 
a daily basis to see if there is anything important is a chore.

With a news list I get propmted when there is someing new, as well as an 
easy place to drop new idea's onto.

I am just about finished my animatronics controller and plan to announce it 
here

take Care
Marc

What I should have said was;

I've not done any work on it the last few years. Others have added to it, 
so it was looking a little better than how I had it. Next problem is the 
listing of resources, which is now way outa date.

Anyway, back to the list and suiting discussion...

Hi everyone! GreenReaper, founder of the . . . um, "furwiki" here - a 
first-time poster, but long-time fursuit admirer. :-)

This list has quite a history. Robert and Yappy (and probably others I don't 
know of) deserve a great deal of credit for keeping it going for the last 
decade and a half. But the archives show a clear decline in traffic over the 
past few years.

I'm not sure it's necessary to close it unless the mail is bothering people 
(if so, it's easy for them to pause delivery via 
http://lists.fursuit.org/mailman/listinfo/fursuit-list ) - but if there's 
interest in performing the original "mission" of providing a significant 
service to fursuiting, a different method seems appropriate.

Mailing lists are not a key method of communication for today's users. Heck, 
*email* is pass? - at least, among those taking their first steps into 
fursuiting. If it's not browser-based, the latest generation of fans are 
unlikely to use it. The same goes for newsgroups, as shown by the decline of 
alt.fan.furry.

As Yappy says, most fursuiters and fursuit-builders now look to various 
web-based journals and forums, many focusing on specific aspects of fursuit 
creation and performance. It's not that hard to understand why.

Imagine having this entire discussion all on one page, like this:
http://www.flayrah.com/c/ning-drop-free-services-communities-face-fees

It's a lot more convenient than skipping between posts - especially if you 
can read it from anywhere without logging into your email account, and 
respond without leaving the page.

Now, as for what to do with the website . . .

fursuit.org/.com is a good name. It seems like it might be a good place to 
get fursuit information. But right now it isn't particularly compelling to 
visitors (adorable artwork aside), so they don't stick around very long. 
This is a shame as it has some interesting content, and more could be 
gleaned from the mailing list archives and other linked resources.

While this content should be saved - as should the archives of this mailing 
list, whether or not it is closed - I don't think it's a good idea to try to 
merge it into WikiFur. Copyright issues aside, it's not the same type of 
content. The list has always been more "how to" than encyclopedia material. 
WikiFur editors distrust personal accounts, essays, opinion, etc., and it's 
not what readers expect, either.

I also don't like the idea of a static archive. That's essentially what it 
has been for the last few years. It doesn't seem to have been much use to 
people in that format - hardly surprising given subsequent development in 
fursuiting techniques.

Instead, what if we kept the idea of an active, smaller wiki dedicated to 
fursuiting? We could switch it over to MediaWiki, put it up at 
wiki.fursuit.org, open it up to wider editing, linking it to WikiFur's 
account system so people can use existing accounts, and get it seeded with 
fifty to a hundred well-formatted pages on various topics.

This is not an overnight job - you cannot just put a wiki up and expect it 
to work. It will require ongoing content maintenance and promotion from 
community members.

Still, I bet at least about half the necessary content is present already in 
some form, and I'm sure more could be created to fill the gaps - or, 
perhaps, adapted from the relevant fursuit LiveJournal posts (if nothing 
else, we could summarize and reference their "memories").

I can help make the first part of that happen, and I'm sure Timduru would be 
glad to host it along with WikiFur. What I do not have time to do is 
maintain the wiki on an editorial level, but I suspect there are others out 
there who could. Perhaps some are on this mailing list.

Then there's fursuit.org itself. If we've moved the FAQ wiki away, this 
should be a different site. But what?

A recent example of something which didn't work was the Fursuit Lounge.
It had some interesting features but there was really no reason to go there.
We need either compelling content of our own, useful aggregation, or both.

And we need to avoid treading on other people's toes. As noted by Yappy, 
there already exist venues providing many different services to fursuiters 
and fursuit buliders. There is no need to duplicate them. What seems to be 
lacking is a site to tie them together.

With this in mind, I think the best use for fursuit.org is to provide a live 
portal/launchpad - a kind of "one stop shop" for fursuiters looking for a 
homepage.

This portal might draw from/link to/feature these, and more:
* posts from LiveJournal communities like 
fursuit/fursuitlounge/fursuit_auctions
* material from the Fursuit Wiki
* suits from the Fursuit Database ( http://db.fursuit.org/ )
* photos/video from the Fursuit Archive ( http://fursuit.timduru.org/ )
* the latest episode of Fursuit TV ( http://fursuittv.timduru.org/ )
* fursuiting news and features from Flayrah ( 
http://www.flayrah.com/category/tags/fursuits )
* topics from The Fursuit Forum ( http://80scartoons.net/fursuitforum/ )
* relevant chat rooms, additional resources, and this mailing list

Ideally it would *not* require much effort to maintain freshness, just a bit 
of technical know-how to add features over time and fix it if it breaks. If 
and when it starts to get significant traffic, we could introduce more 
social features, such as a forum or site chat, and perhaps additional 
original content.

So that's my vision of what could be - two sites which draw together 
resources from yesterday and today to serve the fursuiters of tomorrow. Is 
this something you feel would be beneficial? Would anyone like to help?

Hi Folks,
   It's been a long time since I created this list back in 1993.  In 
about 1998 the list got to be too much for me to handle and I had to 
stop being an active moderator and back away.  (Thanks Yappy for taking 
the controls).

I've since raised two boys and they are now heading off to college. 
I've started a convention (Midwest FurFest) and it's been running for 10 
years now.

Wow - the years have flown by.  I still remember sitting on that 
airplane with Porsupah saying "You know - I could set up a mailing list 
so we could share all this information..."

I'm glad to hear that some folks still get some good from it, and I'm 
glad to see that some of our founding members are still around.

I see a split over "keep it" vs "time to go"  (as usual ;)

In the end, it will boil down to a cost-benefit sort of decision - Right 
now this list costs us a little bit of server resources and a domain.
We're in no hurry to kill it - I was just worried that it was becoming 
just a useless bit of clutter on the net.

Continue your discussions and we'll continue thinking about what is the 
best direction to take.

Thank You!

I say keep the list. I run a couple lists, one of which I keep on y!groups for mostly historical reasons, one of which is on this server that I first joined as a user about 15 years ago.

The one on Yahoo is a fan list for rock group Toad The Wet Sprocket and doesn't get much traffic since they broke up around ten years ago.

This said, it isn't really a great reason to kill a list because of low or trivial traffic. I say keep it around.

I guess it boils down to if you want an archive and what type. Web interfaces 
like LJ and that will not archive well at the local level unless you have a tool 
that goes out and grabs the web content and puts it on a local storage unit and 
being web based will also take up a lot of space. This list I have been 
collecting all the content simply by not deleting anything and the usual mail 
backup tool keeps it safe and it is really easy to do. I have always liked mail 
lists because that they are easy to read (using your favorite mail tool) and 
manage. All my Yahoo Gps are set to mail me the content keeping it simple and 
easy to use and archived as well on my local mail server so if a list goes away 
I have all that content saved here. Some times newer is not better but I 
certainly would not want to see this list go and just because I don't post very 
much does not mean that I don't read other folks posts. BTW FA is not accepting 
new users so that is really not available to new folks.

If you can please keep this list

I like a mailing list.  It's low maintenance.  I can leave it for a while,
and come back to it, and it's ok.

I don't like logging in and chasing threads on Forums.  They can be scoped
out by robots and attacked by trolls.  They require building a profile, and
just... attention that I want to save for more important projects.

Topically, I can use FL better, and have done.

Cheers,

I still very much love the list.  It is interesting to see how others are
solving fursuit making issues and using those as ideas on how I can make the
few suits I do make better.

I vote for keeping the list.  It is relatively spam-free and much easier
than a forum.  I feel that if the list were closed and ended, we would miss
out on helping others or discovering what new ideas others are coming up
with.

Hi Folks
Ok.. a real update.

I have just finished the workings for a Magic Staff system. This is a staff
that can respond to gestures without actually touching it

Its made up of several different components that I will describe.

Firstly I have a nice large quartz crystal.  Its clear but with some
interesting bluish striations throught it. Under it is a  light that is a
150,000mCD white LED and a small red laser.

Both of these are controlled by a PicAxe 08M.

The 08M also has connected to it 2 small HALL effect devices. this trigger
on and off  from the presence of a strong magnetic field.

To power this system I have a small 2v to 5v convertor board.

When all hooked together with some simple code to make the white LED pulse
with different patterns and to thrun on the red laser I can do this. The
HALL effect devices are hidden in part of the fancy surround on teh Crystal

Place the staff somewhere of hold it in my hand.  With a glove that has a
small rare-earth magnet swen into it I can gesture over the crystal in one
direction and the crystal glows and pulses. Gesture the other way and the
crystal turns a deep red.  Repeat the gesture and the crystal returns to it
white display, or  finally gesture again over the staff and the crystal goes
dark.

The beauty of this setup is that there is no physical contact with the
crystal or staff. I can hand the staff to someone and they will try
everything to find the hidden switches... just not realising tht they need a
magnet to send the commands. And I just have to gesture again and it turns
on in their hands.

Greetings,

Someone (a mundane) contacted the West Michigan Film Video Alliance 
Google group (a mundane group) looking for a costume maker. I thought 
I'd pass it along :)

Key points to keep in mind if you make contact:
- The person looking for a costume maker is not a furry nor is the group 
he posted to a furry group.
- Make sure to read the forwarded email as he needs a dozen costume, not 
one.
- As he's posting to a Michigan group, he's probably in Michigan and 
will need them shipped there.

Moo,

"Cow"

Hi Folks

Just another update on advanced features for fursuits.  One of my Holy
Grails with a fursuit is to be able to control it's animatronics without
been seen to control it by a watcher.  Imaging your character walking around
smiling, laughing, and growling with ease and NO-ONE knew how you were doing
this.

There has been many interfaces - magents and switches in the paws so you can
touch finger to thumb and control things etc. However thats is still a
movement that can be seen.

With the release of the PicAXE 18M2 this can be made MUCH easier.   The 18M2
has the new Microchip circuitry for touch sensing., and the test/development
board is here

http://www.techsupplies.co.uk/epages/Store.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/Store
.TechSupplies/Products/AXE181

Now this is Capacitance touch sensing that means that there is no electrical
contact with the board, infact the contacts must be isolated!. This also
means that there is no chance that you can get shocked by the contacts.

How can we use this.  We can all stick out tounges out and move it around,
so if a plastic curve with the contacts behind it was placed just in front
of the mouth it would be easy to to touch.

I estimates that is would be easy to control 3 sensors  (Left, Right, and
Front) though 5 sensors could be put in and handled comfortably.

With the 3 sensors one could do a

LEFT - Active for cmand
MIDDLE - Tap out command number
RIGHT - Execute command

With the cost of this board (and it includes the 18M2) being only  $23AUD
(and there are disributers around the world including US) it makes it a very
easy add on for any techincally minded suit maker

Hope this helps.  I will be making a video of my experiments and putting it
on YouTube

Take Care
Marc

FC 2011 September Newsletter

In this issue:
1. Convention Dates Changed
2. Furry Market Place already at 50% capacity!
3. Dealer Room Waiting List
4. Panelists and performers wanted for the FC puppet track!
5. Species Track
6. THE PROGRAM BOOK NEEDS YOU!
7. Open Lead Positions for FC 2011
8. Annual Further Confusion camp-out and picnic
9. Next Staff Meeting


1. Convention Dates Changed

The dates for our 2011 convention have changed. We now have the Martin
Luther King holiday Jr. (U.S.) weekend dates of January 13th - 17th. Please
be sure your travel, hotel reservations dates, and vacation requests match
up with our new dates.



2. Furry Market Place already at 50% capacity!

Spaces in the Furry Market Place are going fast! If you have a desire to
sell your wares at Further Confusion 2011 and that material is acceptable
to all audiences, then the Furry Market Place may work for you. Head on
over to the Furry Market Place page of the Further Confusion website at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2011/dealers/marketplace> for all the
rules and limitations, as well as the Furry Market Place signup form.

If the Furry Market Place will work for you, fill out the signup form and
send it in with your US$75.00 payment (personal check or money orders only,
please) to the address given on the form. Sales of Furry Market Place
spaces will close when all 20 have sold, or December 15th 2010, whichever
comes first.

We will NOT be selling spaces at the con this year. Once sales have closed
in December any unsold spaces will be offered as extra space for our
charities.



3. Dealer Room Waiting List

The Dealer Room Waiting list is the place you want to apply to if you find
the Furry Market Place will not fit your needs.

When someone that currently has a table in the Further Confusion 2011
Dealer Room finds that they will not be able to make it to the convention,
they contact us and get their full refund. Then the space they gave up gets
offered in a 'Random Lottery' to a person on the waiting list.
Cancellations can happen at any time. We've already had one and gave that
space to a luck person from the waiting list. The most common time to have
cancellations is in the last 6 weeks before the convention. In some of our
past years every person on the waiting list got into the main dealer room.
But there have also been times when that has not been the case.

Our recommendation, even if you DO choose to apply to the waiting list, is
to look at the list of dealers shown on the website, and if you see one of
your friends there, ask them if they are going to need help manning their
table. Maybe the will split the cost of the table with you?

And remember, whatever you do, if you are going to sell product at the
convention, to seek a sellers permit from the California Board of
Equalization BEFORE you get to the convention.

If you choose to get on the waiting list, go to the Dealers page on the
Further Confusion website and download the Waiting List Application. Fill
it out and send it in to the address on the form.

We will close the Waiting List to new applicants on December 15th, 2010.



4. Panelists and performers wanted for the FC puppet track!

We are currently looking for both panelists and performers to help with the
puppetry track at FC 2011. We have a long history of having a great track,
and I am working to make sure 2011 continues this. If you want to run a
panel, help on a panel, or perform in the puppet shows, drop us a line and
let us know, and we can get you added in. Contact our Puppetry Track Lead
through email at tiresta at grics.net, and he will get back to you asap and we
can work out what you would like to do.



5. Species Track

Want to run a Species Panel? We are waiting to hear back from last years
panelists for some panels but right now Canines, Avian Furs, the Dragon
Panel, Ungulates Panel and Created Species. We may have others come up and
if there is another panel that you would like to run please just e-mail us
and ask. Time is short to get these panels lined up so please act quickly.
If you have any questions at all please e-mail our Species Track lead at
kiteless.dragon at gmail.com.



6. THE PROGRAM BOOK NEEDS YOU!

The first of October is the deadline for submitting art and writing to the
Further Confusion program book! That means we have less than a month to
gather illustrations and writing from authors and artists throughout the
land. If you're one of those creative people, please send us something. If
you know some of those creative people, please ask them to send us
something. It can be new work or existing work, as long as it's
appropriate. Requirements and specifications can be found on the convention
Web site at <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2011/policies/conbook>. Any
questions not addressed by the Web page can be directed to
conbook at furtherconfusion.org. 



7. Open Lead Positions for FC 2011

We are looking for persons with an eye for details and can stay up on their
email to run some of our tracks.

Social Track. 
We have our Main Stage dances taken care of (Thanks to DJ
Tigon from WA) but many volunteers for various entertainment related panels
need arranging and room bookings. You could also seek out other possible
events like the poi and light toys workshop of previous years.

Species Track.
Critters! This also includes events like our two Dragon Panels.

Spirituality Track.
Currently this is our smallest track, but certainly has the potential to be
made larger.



8. Annual Further Confusion camp-out and picnic

Just a quick reminder that our annual camp-out will be taking place from
Friday 10th through Sunday 12th of September, up at Anthony Lake Chabot
Campground.

While reservations for camping are now closed, our Annual Picnic will be
held on Saturday 10th down in the picnic area of the park. All are welcome
to the picnic, and no sign-up is necessary!



9. Next Staff Meeting

Our next staff meeting will be on September 18th, starting at 1:00pm in the San
Jose Fairmont. Check the lobby electronic sign for our room assignment.
Parking is available in the surrounding area but is not free. The parking
lot closest to the hotel will run $7 for the duration of the meeting.

Moo!

So, a few years ago I saw a fursuit video online. I've since lost the link
and have been trying to relocate the video with no success. Might anyone be
able to assist? Here are some of the video details I can remember:

- There were 1 or 2 rabbit/bunny fursuiters, an unseen camera opt, there
might have been some non suiters tagging along
- They were running amuck inside a mall
- The rabbits/bunnies were tumbling and other acrobatic type stuff while
causing chaos
- They might have continued amuck in surrounding area outside of the mall

I'm after the video as it's a good example of advanced suiting techniques
(acrobatic stunts). Granted there are plenty of pro mascot stunt videos out
there. Yet, I liked this one as well since it wasn't pro suiters on an
official job. It was just fursuiters with acrobatic skills having fun.

Thanks,

"Cow"

I only know of so many wabbits that come close to any acrobatics that
I know of (or to some degree).

First we have Equal, Sweet N Low and Splenda.

There's also Sinatra.

Maybe you could give us some other details like if the rabbit is male
or female, or at least the fur coloring (would greatly help narrow the
search down).

The video from Groove Armada isn't it. Though, if I can't find the one I
remember then I'll probably use it instead since it shows all the points
except for the non-pro part.

I've also got the kangaroo video by Remi Gaillard as one example. But I'm
using that in the list of examples of "why you should be careful when you
fursuit as this might be people's prior experience with fursuits" type
thing.

The body type was gender neutral. The coloring was all brown or possibly
brown with a white chest.

You can get the long pile and just shave it down to the length you need if that helps some.

In the article the people doing the house basically said that they
were using juxtaposition to try and increase the impact of something
scary.  Kinda like how in "The Ring" the fact that it was a little
dead girl killing people made it more freaky than if it were, say, a
serial killer who had died in a prison or mental institution.  It's
not a technique that's guaranteed to work (see below) but when it does
it can be quite effective.

I've actually forced myself to watch this movie (I wish I hadn't).  It
was, hands down, the worst movie I have ever seen.  And I have seen a
handful of Troma films.  It's titled "Serial Rabbit"

For reasons I can't fully comprehend white rabbit suits have really blown up recently on the haunted house scene. White rabbits are becoming the new evil clown. 

For example there's this very nice mass production "Peter Rottentail" suit.

and there's been some characters with custom suits from big haunted attractions...

and little two bit haunts...

Can't really explain it, not sure why people are going with rabbits.

There is, however, a pretty famous urban legend/possible actual incident where it might have started: the Bunny Man of rural Virginia. This tale of a fursuited killer and the railroad tracks where his victims turn up has been floating around since the 70's.

First it was werewolves, then evil clowns (Stephen King's IT), now it's 
evil rabbits? Ye gods, what's next?

As it turns out, I'm not far from the area. Take a look at the coordinates 
in the wikipedia page, then follow Bing's Bird's Eye link.

Halloween cometh. I may very well visit for the heck of it.

That reminds me... We've had a couple people put cameras in their heads 
rather than use their eyes. How about using a digicam as part of your suit 
head to take pics? No need to carry around a camera. Just push a button on 
your chin or paw, and you got a pic.

With the current suit I am working on I am using the video system that
Lionel (LionoftheSun) has developed. That is the one where you view the
world through iPod Video glasses and have the camera's elsewhere in the
suit.

Anyway - I was able to pick up a very cheap video tranmitter/reciever board
set where size of the board is about 2.5cm x 2.5cm.

So I put the transmitter in the head with the camera's and the IPod glasses.

I was able to pick up a little 5" LCD monitor from eBay that is used to car
reversing systems, and added the reciever to that with a little 12V battery
part.

The result...  WolfCam.  I can hand the LCD to someone and then wander
around , and they can see everything that I am seeing :>

I also have a On-Screen-Display chip (Max7456) so I can overlay menu's, info
like battery voltage, and with a sonar how far things are from my muzzle..
And all of this is also fed to the LCD so it can almost look like a
Terminator display printout.

I know.. very high tech.. But I enjoy the development

Take Care

1. Fairmont sold out, overflow hotel opening soon


We're sorry to say the Fairmont is now sold out. Please stay tuned to our website, Forums, LiveJournal, and other venues for an upcoming announcement when the overflow hotel block opens. The overflow hotel is again the St. Claire, just a short stroll from the Fairmont. Information on the overflow will be released soon. For your convenience here is a walking map of the downtown area:

<http://www.sjredevelopment.org/PublicationsPlans/walkingMap.pdf>


2. Furry Market Place already at 55% capacity!

Spaces in the Furry Market Place are going fast! If you have a desire to sell your wares at Further Confusion 2011 and that material is acceptable to all audiences, then the Furry Market Place may work for you. Head on over to the Furry Market Place page of the Further Confusion website at <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2011/dealers/marketplace> for all the rules and limitations... as well as the Furry Market Place sign-up form.

If the Furry Market Place will work for you, fill out the sign-up form and send it in with your $75.00 payment (personal check or money orders only, please) to the address given on the form. Sales of Furry Market Place spaces will close when all 20 have sold, or December 15th 2010, whichever comes first. We will NOT be selling spaces at the con this year. Once sales have closed in December any unsold spaces will be offered as extra space for our charities.


3. Dealer Room Waiting List

The Dealer Room Waiting list is the place you want to apply to if you find the Furry Market Place will not fit your needs. When someone that currently has a table in the Further Confusion 2011 Dealer Room finds that they will not be able to make it to the convention, they contact us and get their full refund. Then the space they gave up gets offered in a 'Random Lottery' to a person on the waiting list. Cancellations can happen at any time. We've already had one and gave that space to a luck person from the waiting list. The most common time to have cancellations is in the last 6 weeks before the convention. In some of our past years every person on the waiting list got into the main dealer room. But there have also been times when that has not been the case. Our recommendation, even if you DO choose to apply to the waiting list, is to look at the list of dealers shown on the website, and if you see one of your friends there, ask them if they are going to need help manning their table. Maybe the will split the cost of the table with you? And remember, whatever you do, if you are going to sell product at the convention, to seek a sellers permit from the California Board of Equalization BEFORE you get to the convention. If you choose to get on the waiting list, go to the Dealers page on the Further Confusion website and download the Waiting List Application. Fill it out and send it in to the address on the form. We will close the Waiting List to new applicants on December 15th, 2010.


4. Still accepting Con Book submissions

The official deadline for con book submissions has passed. However we will be extending it and are currently still accepting submissions, both written and drawn. Requirements and specifications can be found on the convention Web site at <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2011/policies/conbook>.

Any questions not addressed by the Web page can be directed to conbook at furtherconfusion.org. Thanks, and we look forward to hearing from you!


5. Badge Art Wanted!

Further Confusion is currently seeking artwork submissions for the 2011 membership badge inserts. Both color and black & white artwork will be accepted, and all artwork will be considered on overall 'look and feel', plus these additional points: Size: Art must scale to be printed at 4" x 2".

Theme: Art must accurately reflect the theme of the con. Age appropriateness: The art must be suitable for viewing by children. Branding: 'FC', 'FurCon' or 'Further Confusion' and the convention year, '2011', must be present. Artists submitting images should be aware that there is no payment for badge art chosen, and the artist gives Further Confusion the right to reproduce the image in the con program book and as badge art for FC2011. The artist will be credited on the insert and in the con program book. The artist retains all other copyrights and reproduction rights beyond the above. Submission deadline is November 1st, 2010. All qualifying submissions will be seriously considered and 6 designs will be chosen for use. All artists will be notified by December 1st as to whether or not their submissions have been chosen. Submissions should be in JPG format at best possible quality compression, 300 DPI (1200x600 pixels) minimum. An 8" by 4" original scanned at 300 DPI produces a good file to work with. Badge art submissions should be sent to badge-art at furtherconfusion.org. In the email specify your website (if you want it listed) and how you wish to be credited should your art be chosen.


6. Fursuit Badge submissions

If you have a fursuit, are pre-registered, and need a fursuit badge, here's what to do.  Before January 1, 2011, send a picture of your fursuit to fursuit-badges at furtherconfusion.org and include the following information in the email:

A "no subject" email with just a link that has no indication what the
link is about or where it really leads to being sent to multiple email
addresses? Yeeaaahhh... I'd say this person has had their email
program hijacked by a trojan.

Be smart people, these are the 3 signs that can lead to you getting
infected if you're not careful. Using an external program (eg =
Outlook Express) that holds bookmarks to peoples email addresses can
be hijacked if you click on an link like that.

Message-ID: <203572.41779.qm@web50302.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I've done some vacuuforming for some projects of mine, but I'm troubled by a 
problem that I can't solve.

Many times, the final plastic product is plagued by wrinkles as the  plastic 
conforms to the final shape.  I simply cannot figure out why it  does it and why 
it doesn't, and I don't have much time or spare plastic  to figure it out.  
Anyone have any experience with the process that can  help out?

I'm using a home-built box and I'm heating stuff in the oven.

I have had this problem in the past and it was due to two factors. 1) turning off the vacuum too soon and, 2) overheating the plastic I overcame this by mounting the cold stock over the mould then slowly heating the stock by hand with a heat gun. This only works with smaller projects due to the heat required (more if you are using styrene...less if you are using gec)

I found a site that mentioned excess plastic as another cause.  I made a smaller 
box, and that seemed to work.  I figured excess heat was an issue as well, but 
I'd been having trouble getting that aspect sorted out.

I have had this problem in the past and it was due to two factors. 1) turning 
off the vacuum too soon and, 2) overheating the plastic I overcame this by 
mounting the cold stock over the mould then slowly heating the stock by hand 
with a heat gun. This only works with smaller projects due to the heat required 
(more if you are using styrene...less if you are using gec)
