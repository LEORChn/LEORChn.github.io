The Burned Furs group offically died years ago shortly after going
totally insane and losing almost all of it's core supporters.  Yes I
have been in the fandom long enough to remeber that.

Message-ID: <45999D0E.1050902@bluemarble.net>

As many of you know, my furry surname is Greenbear.  I've held for a
long time that the "green" is metaphorical, but I've had requests to
bring Greenbear to life; hence the post title.  Anyone know where I can
find a nice plush green fur?  I'm looking for at least a 1/2 inch nap,
and a texture similar to Monterey Mills nutmeg (of which my current suit
is made).  This is going to be a toony suit and is in concept stage
right now.  I might scrap the idea, but that's what January's are for:
Hatching half-baked ideas and seeing what finishes cooking.

Goodness...  what a lot of trouble this guy went through to troll a
bunch of people he doesn't know.

And shame on you, Dennis, Donkey, Al Bear, and Blue Dragon for making me
feed the troll :p

RIP Burned furs.  We we seem to have out-lived you.

My local fabric store has green among other weird colored fur. Why? Don't
ask me. Thay never sale the stuff. Now for colors that I do want like a
brown they never have it in stock. Why again? I have no idea nor does anyone
that works there.

I have a body suit already made in something that I call a shaggy  
sage green. It was going to be an Oscar the Grouch suit, but I kinda  
ran out of interest on this project. Before I modify it for sale, I  
wanted to ask if this might work for you. I also have a couple yards  
extra as well.

Lemme know and we can work out a deal.

Message-ID: <BAY131-DAV14054F9E133C85C2E25C98D8BA0@phx.gbl>

Yes it's the same weekend this year!

I'm just trying to get an idea of how many are planning on coming to MG so I can plan accordingly. I know there are a few that are going to FWA instead. 

so far the tentative plans are:

Friday 2/16

Dinner for those arriving early enough

Cosmic Bowling (Fursuits welcome)

Saturday 2/17

Early start!

Breakfast at the Soulard Coffee Garden

watch the Mardi Gras Grand Parade and get lots of beads

Afternoon after the parade is free

Dinner and then off to the City Museum for a night of fun! (Fursuits welcome)

Sunday 2/18 

Brunch

Outing to the Zoo (weather permitting) 

everyone heads home

Drop me a note either way just so I can get an idea on numbers

Shrek is supposedly an Ogre and not a Troll, but at the time I forgot that 
and rushed to make the joke. Still it was just too tempting not to do it.

If you want to chat, *please* take it to IRC or AIM.

This is a costuming mailing list, not a chatroom.  Resist the temptation 
to make one-liner replies; don't encourage trolls; try to stay on-topic 
(costume building, performing, advice, etc.).  The recent spate of  
posts has really spammed up my mailbox.

Thanks!  Happy New Year!

yeah cus that took me a whole 5 minutes to read through from start to 
finish.

The only differnce between this and a chat room is this is like donkey 
express verse FedEx, it just takes longer.

Oh and Singlespeed, I think that constitutes as off topic chat banter / spam 
from his persepctive too, so well said or not, you didn't follow his request 
:)  Me, I  know I'm not., but it's more then 1 line so i think i'm safe.

P.s. where is all this hot animal sex I keep hearing about, I've yet to find 
it, this fandom is all hype, no action.  hehe.

Looking forward to pictures of all the new suits from FC and see soem of you 
at FWA.  Back to your regular scedualed costume talk.

Well it looks like you will only see one new fursuit from me. The guy that
makes my head frames. (I do the rest including installing the ears and
furing the heads) Only made one of the three that I was expecting to have
done for FC. I guess you will have to wait for Califur to see the others
that I have planed.

His Most Royal Highass, Donkey

I know... This was off topic to Lance. Oh well. Cant please everyone.

I'm curious if all the participants in the film were consenting  
because it looked like a few of the people being accosted were rather  
pissed at being non-consensually humpped by a giant rabbit. Other

Greetings, everyone!

I've been asked to take on the Fursuiting and Pawpetry Tracks at MegaPLEX this year, and I don't have much time to spare, so I need to get the ball rolling pretty quickly. So, here's a list of the panels I'd like to have hosted at MegaPLEX:

* Intro to Fursuiting 
* Fursuiting Basic Performance 
* Fursuiting Advanced Performance 
* Fursuit Construction Mega Panel [Basics and Advanced Topics] 
* Fursuit Public Performance and Safety 
* Spicing Up Your Fursuiting Life

* Pawpet Performance Techniques 
* Pawpet Improv Workshop 
* Pawpet and Plush Construction 
* Developing Pawpet Skits

If you'd be interested in co-hosting any of these fursuiting or pawpetry panels, or if there's some other kind of fursuiting or pawpetry panel that you'd like to host, then please get in touch with me ASAP

I'm also looking to have an Open Call Pawpet show for the first time this year, so if you'd like to participate in that, please get in touch with me so that I can have an idea on what kind of participation to expect.

hey Santafox,

I would be interested in hosting a panel. The one that I am interested in is
Fursuit Public Performance and Safety.

I have a lot of experience in public fursuiting ranging from structured
charity events as well as out in the open public suiting (i.e restuarants,
various stores, public entertainment areas, parties, etc...). Let me know
the details.

you just take an existing cartoon charicter and make a suit out of that, just  
asking.

Happy New Year from all of us at Megaplex 2007!

I'LL TAKE A HOTEL ROOM TO (FILL OUR) BLOCK

ATTENTION! Reservations close on *January 30, 2007*, so get your rooms
as soon as possible!  Less that a month left to go to get your room at
the con rate!

This year, Megaplex 2007 will be held at the Wyndham Jacksonville
Riverwalk, in downtown Jacksonville, Florida.  The hotel is just off of
I-95, on the Southbank of the St. John's River.  Full directions can be
found on our web site (http://www.ppmp.info).

requires a credit card to use. Here's how:

1) Surf to http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/JAXHT/main.wnt .

2) Click on the "Get Rates or Make A Reservation For This Hotel" link,
just under the hotel's address.

3) On the next page...
    a. Leave "Select A Rate Plan" (Section 1) as "Best Available &
Wyndham.com WEBRATES".
    b. Enter your arrival and departure dates (Section 2).  Remember,

4) The next page shows the rooms available.  You should see "Pawpet Live

at mp-facility at pawpet.org.

The Wyndham is a short distance from the Museum of Science and History
(MOSH), Friendship Park, and River City Brewing Company, which can
easily be reached via the Riverwalk.  The hotel is also a stop for the
S.S. Marine Taxi service (http://www.jaxwatertaxi.com), which is a
convenient way to get to the shops and restaurants at the Jacksonville
Landing (http://www.jacksonvillelanding.com).  You can also utilize the
nearby Skyway service to get to the Landing
(http://www.jtaonthemove.com/services/skyway.aspx), or take a pleasant
stroll over the Main Street Bridge.  For those wanting to stay on the
hotel's side of the river, eateries and stores can be found a short walk
away in the San Marco shopping district.

We'll have additional information on attractions and ammenities on our
web site soon, as well as how to get there from Jacksonville
International Airport.  In the meantime, if you have a question about
Florida's First Coast, drop Karl Meyers a line at mp-ceo at pawpet.org.
(He lives there, after all!  :)

NOW, FOR OUR FEATURE PRESENTA...oops, sorry, last year's theme.  :)

COME ON DOWN!

Florida's furry arts and performance convention is back for another
spin, and this time, we're bringing the fun to the First Coast!
Megaplex 2007 will be held on March 2-4, 2007, at the Wyndham
Jacksonville Riverwalk, in Jacksonville, Florida.

LET'S MEET OUR GUEST OF HONOUR!

Megaplex 2007 is happy to announce that Mike Kazaleh will be joining us
as Guest of Honour this year!  Mike is a professional animator and
comics artist; old-school furry fans will remember his comics work on
"The Adventures of Captain Jack" (Fantagraphics), and "Mean Green Bondo
Machine" and "The Suit" (MU Press).  He has also drawn "Ren and Stimpy"
for Marvel, "Cow and Chicken" for DC Comics, and "The Mighty Mutanimals"
for Archie Comics, and is currently working on "Futurama" for Bongo
Comics and "Camp Lazlo" for DC.

Animation-wise, his credits include "The New Adventures of Mighty
Mouse", "Tiny Toon Adventures", and "The Simpsons"; more recently, he
has worked on "Krypto the Superdog", "Johnny Test", and "Hi Hi Puffy Ami
Yumi".  He was also a storyboard artist for the recent release, "The Ant
Bully".

Please join us in welcoming Mike to Megaplex 2007!

WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR #1?

It's time to play!  This year, we're working up a Game Show theme that
is sure to entertain...especially with our members at the contestants!
Keep an eye on the Events page at http://www.ppmp.info for more details
on the specific games, and how you can play!  There'll be
fursuit-specific games, as well as games for all our members to join in on.

It wouldn't be a game show theme without the return of a crowd favourite
- the Gong Show!  Our annual variety-show-with-a-twist is always
entertaining...play along, even if your act isn't that great; sometimes
it's better to perform and have been gonged than never to have performed
at all!  Contact Josh Strom at mp-variety at pawpet.org if you'd like to
perform in the show.

Whose Line Is It Anyway?  Our improvisational stars', that's who...and
that could include you!  The improv returns for another spin in 2007.

Megaplex also welcomes the return of a couple of guys who always keep us
in stitches - Uncle Kage, and 2, the Ranting Gryphon will be back for
2007, with their unique stories and comedy.  Kage and 2 often test out
new material for Anthrocon here first, so come hear what's up!

DJ Rory will be with us, as well, spinning the tunes for a
fursuit-friendly dance!

There'll be mystery amongst the merriment...more information on this in
coming weeks.

For our fursuiting and puppeteering members, Santa Fox is working those
tracks this year.  Say, here he is now!

"Greetings, everyone!

I've been asked to take on the Fursuiting and Pawpetry Tracks at
MegaPLEX this year, and I don't have much time to spare, so I need to
get the ball rolling pretty quickly. So, here's a list of the panels I'd
like to have hosted at MegaPLEX:

* Intro to Fursuiting
* Fursuiting Basic Performance
* Fursuiting Advanced Performance
* Fursuit Construction Mega Panel [Basics and Advanced Topics]
* Fursuit Public Performance and Safety
* Spicing Up Your Fursuiting Life

* Pawpet Performance Techniques
* Pawpet Improv Workshop
* Pawpet and Plush Construction
* Developing Pawpet Skits

If you'd be interested in co-hosting any of these fursuiting or pawpetry
panels, or if there's some other kind of fursuiting or pawpetry panel
that you'd like to host, then please get in touch with me ASAP

I'm also looking to have an Open Call Pawpet show for the first time
this year, so if you'd like to participate in that, please get in touch
with me so that I can have an idea on what kind of participation to expect."

If you're interested in helping out with the above, drop Santa a note at
mp-fursuit at pawpet.org, or mp-puppet at pawpet.org!

Plus, we'll be bringing back the late-night showing of the Rocky Horror
Picture Show, a smash hit from 2006!  (Yes, we're bending the rating a
little for this one - badges will be checked at the door, and no minor
badges will be admitted.)

If you have any other ideas for a panel or event that fits into our
theme for 2007, drop John Cole a line at mp-programming at pawpet.org .  We
want your feedback on exactly what you want to see at the convention,
and we want to get with folks who would like to run said panels and
events.  Megaplex is ultimately the members' convention, so help make it
the best it can be!

We're always on the lookout for volunteers, as well.  Drop us a note if
you'd like to help out in March.

HAVE YOU VISITED THE WEBSITE LATELY?

What can you do on http://www.ppmp.info/ ?  Well, you can register for
the convention, order your con t-shirt, reserve your dealer's room
table(s), and purchase con book advertisements and personals!  Not to
mention, we'll be updating the site regularly with news and notes to get
you ready for the con.

Also, keep an eye on our "megaplex" community on LiveJournal, for
additional information from not only the staff of Megaplex, but our
members as well!  That site is http://megaplex.livejournal.com/ .

WHAT ARE T-SHIRTS, ALEX?

We will have Megaplex 2007 t-shirts...with a design by our Guest of
Honour, Mike Kazaleh!  Be sure to order yours when you register - we
won't have that many available beyond what is ordered, and if last year
was any indication, the extras will go fast!

T-Shirts are $12 for Small through 2X-Large when pre-ordered.

DEALERS ROOM TABLES!

Our members asked for it, so Megaplex is bringing back a traditional
Dealer Room in 2007!  Bring your art, comics, clothing, DVDs - whatever
you'd like to show!

Full tables are only $40 apiece (limit two) - grab one for yourself, or
find a partner to share.  Register for your tables when you register for
the convention - it's easy to do!  Go to http://www.ppmp.info and follow
the "Reg" link.

Reserve early! Space is limited - first come, first served!

NOTE : Please remember the rating! All materials being displayed
publicly must be no more than PG-13 rated. Applying labels or other
coverings in order to conceal its objectionable portions will not be
acceptable.  If you have any questions on this, contact Karl Meyers on
mp-ceo at pawpet.org.

STAY TUNED!

Keep an eye on http://www.ppmp.info/ and
http://megaplex.livejournal.com/ for the latest news and information,
and please do not hesitate to drop us a line at
megaplex-feedback at pawpet.org (or to the chairman directly at
mp-ceo at pawpet.org) if you have suggestions or questions regarding the
convention.

Also, please join our dedicated mailing list for Megaplex!  Information
on joining can be found at
http://lists.pawpet.org/mailman/listinfo/megaplex-list .

Hope to see you at Megaplex 2007!

Well most fursuits are "originals" But I , for one, very much enjoy seeing  
costumes of existing characters.
I made a Chester Cheetah costume because he is my favorite character. He  
will be at FWA.

I've seen Don Carnage (Tailspin), Bugs Bunny, Wile E. Coyote, Uncle Scar and Timon (Lion King), Balto, The Geiko Gecko, Hong Kong Phooey, most of the Banana Splits, half the characters from the musical "Cats", Minerva Mink (Animaniacs), Gamera, Gozdilla, Minya and Nicodemus (Secret of Nimh) replicated at various conventions.

Look at your typical Sci-fi convention. There's a dozen Jedi, a score of Kilngons, and platoon of imperial troopers intermingled with tributes to The 5th Element, Farscape, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and 93 other shows and movies which you may or may not have heard of.

Tribute costumes are a long established tradition in all geek related fandoms, so you go do that thing you do. We'll support you all the way and would be glad to see it finished.

We've all seen quite a few good ones out there. It's not unusual to mix a 
fursuit with a facial makeup job like straight makeup or appliances. I've 
done this plenty of times. Only difference with this is that it takes 
longer to put on, anywhere from an hour or more. I had one that took 4 
hours to do several years ago.

You may also want to refer to the fursuit FAQ/wiki.

They were speaking Portuguese, not French, in the video.  What a tacky 
rabbit suit!  I didn't find it funny, just disturbing.

   I'm curious if all the participants in the film were consenting
because it looked like a few of the people being accosted were rather
pissed at being non-consensually humpped by a giant rabbit. Other
than that... funny as hell!

Dowatchewlike!

I've seen all sorts of suits. Originals, knock-offs and commercially- 
produced ones. Hell, you don't even need to have a fursuit to go to a  
con.

last year, I met someone who was a guest of the hotel on a business  
trip during a convention. He wound up getting a badge and had a blast  
the entire weekend. Every time I crossed paths with him, he had a  
huge smile on his face.

Completely up to you. I`ve seen plenty of existing cartoon characters at
cons. It`s your choice. ^.^

The only restriction is it has to be G rated. Privet part covered if your
suit is anatomically correct. Most cons say no bondage stuff. Unless its
something that is normal for the fursuits species. Dog fursuits can have
leashes. Equines and can have bridals and saddles or a harness. Stuff like
that.

Hi Tilt,

Not to try and stray off topic, but I just had to say that the cheetah suit 
you made is fantastic.  I think the character was more hugely popular in the 
states but i recall a time he was aired over here as well before becoming a 
kinda background icon for walkers UK.

The head is hilariously huge, which adds great character appeal.  I just 
have to ask, how heavy is something like that?  I presume its all foam?  I 
ask because I have a sylvester the cat suit and his head is huge, made 
mostly of paper and masche moulded.   He is a tad on the heavy side :)

Regards,

Colifox

I would be careful about copy right stuff. Check it out before you make it. We make custom designed mascots and if anyone asks for a copyright character we stay clear of it. Not willing to take a chance with law suits.

I think that is a good idea to the studios let people make costumes of there
characters for fan events. Its free publicity. Most comic book/strips
encourage it. In San Diego at Comic Con. The comic company's give prises at
the costume contest to the fans that make costumes that represent there
characters the best. I think I remember one prise being $500 in products.
Some have prises of $100 to $200 in cash.

  Yeah, copyrights are a pain in the tail. You can get away with on a very limited basis. Being a cosplayer and having a strong basis in anime, I've had to deal with the copyright issue quite a lot. I have found that the following is true:

  -You can make a costume of a copyrighted character (SWAT Kats, Care Bears, etc.) for "fan" purposes, and as long as you're not using it to turn a profit or trying to portray the actual character or represent the studio in public, then you're okay. Keep the costumes to private functions like conventions or fan meets. 

  -Japanese studios seem to be the least concerned about copyrights. Anime characters are widely accepted in fan works such as costumes and artwork, so you're pretty safe there as well.

  -When in doubt, contact the studio and ask permission.

Hello all you Performers out there

This is a call for all those in the Upstate New York region!

A local ABA basketball team, the Rochester Razorsharks,  are hosting a 
Mascot Basketball Game on Jan 13th.  They are in need of several characters 
to perform at this event.  It would involve meet'n'tgreets, fan entertaining 
and crowd roaming, and of course the mascot basketball game at half time.

The game is an afternoon game with a start time at around 2:05PM, so you 
will be getting out before evening.

If you are interested in this event, email me privately and provide the 
following information, and I'll get you in touch with the Sales/Event 
Manager, Kim.

Please let me know what suit (i.e., specie and name of character) you will 
be bringing, your real name and email, and from there I'll get you more 
info, including the invitation  form and team contact info.

PLEASE NOTE
This is a volunteer event, don't expect a pay check.

Hope to hear from you all soon

Nick Hadad

Not always... though it's probably not as big of a deal to comic book 
characters... but if for example someone made a really amazing likeness to 
"Barney" and took it to a small convention where they were videotaped doing 
something similar to the rabbit in that video that was recently passed 
around the board... you can see how the people at HIT entertainment would be 
pretty mad... especially if it ended up on youtube, or getting little news 
stories here and there.  Parents searching youtube for footage of a barney 
concert for their 3 year old running across that might be upset, and if the 
company doesn't sue the pants off people for doing that, then the company is 
liable to get sued by parents.

So, yeah... it depends on who the character is, and how they're being 
portrayed, and if the company has strict rules about their copyrighted 
material.

I'm thinking of making a dragon fursuit head, but I'm not sure of what the best materials are to use. I know some people use foamies, but the material seems too...smooth and squishy. I also have pleather, but not enough to cover everything. Are there any things I can use that have a 'hard' feel to them that would work well?

Laura Whent created a wonderful gryphon head out of soda cans(!)  I  
would've thought the edges would be sharp and nasty, but apparently not:

	http://www.dragonfyredawn.com/costuming/gryphon/gryphon.html

Might make an excellent (and affordable) medium for a dragon as  
well.  One could even use different brands and flavors of soda to add  
coloration.

   Who and what suits are going?  
   What kind of stuff can you do at Midwest FurFest?

Hey there ^^

1. No fursuit floor.  There's really no need for one at MFF.
2. I never miss it.  My suit can be seen here:
www.furaffinity.net/user/aerak.  Last MFF I believe there were over 200
fursuiters.  That's a lot of individuals to name.
3. Fursuit, attend panels, attend contests, hang out, buy artwork and
clothes and such, commission people... there's really too much stuff for me
to list it all.
4. Definitely!  Besides Mephit Furmeet MFF is my favorite furry convention
^^

1) there is a very nice fursuit lounge to accomadate the fursuiters. In
terms of a floor for fursuiters, the answer is no.
2) Ill be there. Name is Lace and my fursuit is my fursona, which is a black
wolf.
3) Loads of things to do. Good dances, awesome people, panels, games, etc..
4) MFF is a must go to con. I had a blast last year, and even more fun this
year.

Thanks for speaking up on that, Blue.  And the other two have pretty
much summed up the other questions as well.  MFF is a very good con,
and I should know being a staff member of MFF myself working the
Puppet Track and helping with the MFF FVS as well (assisstant
director).

As for suits I'll have there next year, a bit early to tell...but I'll
definitly be picking through these suits:
http://wildfox.chameleon.net/main.php?g2_itemId=28 and should have a
new coyote suit by then to take with me as well!

For those of you in the Downstate New York region....
 
For the past several years, "Rapid T. Rabbit and Friends" had been doing a  
similar event at the Stony Brook University Seawolves basketball game on Long  
Island.  At the present time, the team has not decided yet for certain if  
they will have their "mascot day" event this season but I am waiting for a  
decision on that.  On my suggestion, they are considering adding it onto a  
promotion that they already have scheduled for Sunday February 11, which will be  the 
birthday celebration for Wolfie, the university's mascot.  I will post  again 
here if the event is confirmed.

The real question is....will it ever get released at all?
 
I've been in touch with the producer and he says there are too many  
liscensing issues (and the costs thereof) regarding many characters who appeared  in 
it, which so far have been thwarting the film getting even seen below Canada  
(except for those of you attending FC?).
 
Heck, I was the first fursuiter interviewed for the movie, gave them lots  of 
my footage (including my tape from the Mascot Hall of Fame ceremonies)  and 
had the producer and director as guests on my TV show and I still haven't  even 
seen it yet....  :(

That's why I get my own room and share with others. No one can back out on
me with out me with out a room. The worst thing that can happen is I don't
have any room mates. And is that a bad thing? I always get my reservation in
as soon as the con says that the rooms are available. No chance of not
getting a room. I would make my room reservation for next years con aka FC08
right now if I could.

Now as for my self. I would not have done such a crappy thing to somebody.
If I found that I could not go. I would do a step by step changing of the
reservation so the people rooming with me wont be with out a room.

You call the hotel and add someone elses name to the reservation. Then you
call and change the credit card info to that person. Then you call and then
if you can have your name removed from the reservation. After three phone
calls. Your out and you did not scrue the people you promised room space to.
I don't see the people that you promised room space to refusing to agreeing
to helping on the proses. Because if they don't there out of the room and
into the hallways.

I'm surprised that Canadian furs have not sent some DVDs across the boarder.

It was actually a pretty good movie. :) 

We were at their, I believe, first screening at a film
fest.  We suited before it to greet people, and, then,
they actually held up the show while we ran to jump
out of our suits and back into the theatre.

As a first timer to MFF this past November, I'll give my ringing endorsement - it's a wonderfully amazing experience, and definitely a great con for fursuiters.  I've never been as overwhelmingly awed as I was when I looked through the room where we lined up for the fursuit parade and all I could see was wall-to-wall fursuits: 213 of them to be exact.  The parade experience alone was well worth the 1,500 mile round-trip for me.

I'll give fair warning, though, that with over a thousand attendees and over two hundred fursuiters, MFF might be a bit overwhelming for someone who's never been to a furry con before.  While I definitely recommend going to MFF if you can, you might want to try finding a way to get to one of the smaller cons this year to get a feel for what cons are like in an environment that isn't so big or jam packed with furs.  If you're not sure what cons are out there, just post telling what part of the country you're in, and I and others here can certainly give you some suggestions.

Of course, if you really can't get to any other cons, don't let me scare you away from MFF.  You'll still have a good time there even without any previous con experience - it'll just be that much more fun if you learn about cons somewhere smaller and then tackle a large con - at least, that's my humble opinion.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

As yet another staff member at MFF, thanks Santa Fox.  We all work hard
to make MFF one heck of a show and were glad you showed up.  When I
wasn't wrangling gophers and had some time to spend with my friends,
your suits were highly entertaining for all of us, especially a
first-time con goer that I managed to drag kicking and screaming from
Buffalo to attend.  I'm pleased to report that he's been bitten by the
fursuiting bug as well and will soon be joining our ranks.

Yup, MFF is definitely one of my favorite cons to
attend.  I missed 2006 but hopefully 2007 will bring
better luck.

One thing that's fantastic about MFF is its location,
it's near a mall and a lot of good restaurants - so it
doesn't suffer from lack of variety, requiring a car,
or having to order out.  And for first time con-goers,
those that might actually want to step out of the
hotel for a little bit, good options ^.^

Yeah, first time con-goers may be a little overwhelmed
(though last time I attended, I thought it was still
in the comfortable size range), but I mean Anthrocon
was my first con so even first timers can survive a
lot of people and chaos of a furcon ^.^  Better
survival tips are for attendees to have some sort of
contact with people before attending, knowing there's
people to meet and do stuff with takes some of the
pressure of the unknown off your shoulders (and thru
those people you'll meet tons more people, it's always
the first contact that's the hardest).  And of course
being part of activities such as fursuiting, or
volunteering for the con can help get you interacting
with a goal rather than worrying about winging a first
impression.

Amount of people in my experience isn't really the
only judge for whether a con is a good first con.  If
you get caught up where a lot of groups don't mingle,
whether they're large or small it'll limit your
experience.  I think activities, panels (heh, I went
to those much more often when I was new to the
convention scene), volunteering - anything to get you
out of your room, meeting people, and having fun -
that's what you got to look for.  And on that end, I
think MFF does very well.

I suggest you check out Mephit Furmeet (www.mephitfurmeet.com) over Labor Day
weekend.  I'm staff there, so I'm a little biased.  It's a nice, "small" Con of
maybe 700 furs.

Rocket City Furmeet (www.rcfm.net) over Memorial Day Weekend.  I haven't been to
this one, but I have a few friends that love this Con.

You also might consider Furry Weekend Atlanta (www.furryweekend.com) the weekend
after Valentine's Day.  I know the staff, and they put on a great show.

Also, if you're comfortable in the St Louis area, Tyger Cowboy
(tygercowboy at gmail.com) puts together a furry contingent for the Mardi Gras
parade in St Louis.  There's usually a small itinerary planned.  It's not a Con,
but it is a good way to meet fursuiters from the region where the midwest, west,
and south meet.  E-mail him for information.

In short, there are plenty of opportunities to sniff around and explore the scene.

Right now I can afford to go to 2 conventions every year. The first one being 
Anthrocon and second is Memphis. If the Atlantic City convention I keep 
hearing about goes through I'll make it a third. But I live in Philadelphia, PA so 
for me there is no local con.

Well, there's always the Cape May Furmeet. 
Hopefully that one will be back "on track" this year.

Other than that the closest con is FurFright up in CT. in October.

 'Allo all, like to start off by sayin' thanks for all the help you give not just me, but all of us. :3
 
 Onto the questions! 
 Firstly. Necks. I've read the FAQ countless times (its a great way to get me in the mood to work on another suit) but the section on necks is still blank. I usually face a bit of a problem when I make them. Looking at other suits sometimes its hard to tell if their necks are attached to their heads, suits, or if they're separate all together. Also, what about closing them up to look "seamless"? So far I've used velcro, but unless I"m standing before I mirror or have help I often can't close it so it looks right. Any suggestions?
 
 Secondly. Footpaw bottoms! There's always the debate of pawpads vs durability, that is, to make them decorative, or made to withstand walking-- and possibly stepping in something when outside (big problem at Oklacon with all the dogs about). So what sorts of things are good for bottoms? Obviously one could just make paws over an old pair of shoes and thus have the shoebottom to walk on, but what about the decorative pawpad route? Perhaps make pads out of rubber, or leather? Cheapest and easy to find materials are always best ;3 Suggestions?
 
 Miscellaneous stuff, Christmas eve I wore my new fursona suit to GameStop and had lots of fun (except my scarf came undone without my knowing and folks could see my neck). Whatchall think?

# MEET OUR 2007 CHARITY: CONSERVATORS' CENTER, INC

Conservators' Center, Inc, or CCI, is a non-profit organization that
works to preserve threatened species.  One of their main ways of doing
this is through a special captive breeding program to help maintain
endangered and threatened species.  While their breeding program is
their main focus, they do accept some animals in urgent and critical
need of rescue, primarily taking in animals that most other
sanctuaries would not be able to handle.  CCI also does community and
school presentations to help educate children and adults in ways that
they can help to preserve species for generations to come.


Please be sure to stop by and meet CCI's representatives at FWA this
year.  If you'd like to help support CCI, you can make direct
contributions to them while at FWA, as well as by donating items to or
buying items at our Charity Auction scheduled for the Saturday
afternnon of FWA.  Further details on the Charity Auction and when and
where you can meet CCI at FWA will be posted in the near future.  For
more information, visit our website at
(http://www.furryweekend.com/charity)


# CHARITY AUCTION

As we have in previous years, Furry Weekend Atlanta will be holding a
charity auction on Sunday to support our 2007 charity (see above). If
you have anything to donate to the auction, bring it with you to the
convention and let our staffers know! We, and our furry friends in
North Carolina, appreciate it!


# PRELIMINARY SCHEDULE POSTED

The preliminary FWA 2007 schedule is now available for online viewing!
Please remember, this is a preliminary schedule, and is still subject
to change between now and the beginning of the con.
(http://www.furryweekend.com/schedule)


# PROGRAMMING SPOTLIGHT: SOLVING FURSUIT CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS

Do you have a fursuit or fursuit piece that you've been working on,
but have gotten stuck trying to figure out some aspect of the design?
Have a finished piece that doesn't fit or move quite right, but can't
figure out how to rework it? Bring your problem parts and pieces to
this interactive workshop where both our panel of expert builders and
the audience will provide insight, ideas, and suggestions to help you
finish or perfect your fursuit. Participants should be aware that this
is an interactive discusssion forum, and that the panelists are
available to provide input, not to actually make physical repairs or
changes to your fursuit.


# PROGRAMMING SPOTLIGHT: LIVE MUSIC

We love music and want it to be part of our weekend! On Friday on the
Main Stage, join Critical Fail, an all-furry rock band out of
Huntsville, Alabama, that will be continuing their annual tradition of
FWA shows this year. Then, on Saturday, rock out with Sub-Level 03,
the furry band out of Oklahoma that has become a staple of furry
conventions everywhere!


# VOLUNTEERS WANTED

Interested in lending a paw at Furry Weekend Atlanta? Let our
volunteering director know! Contact him at
volunteers at furryweekend.com.


# THE FWA MASQUERADE

The FWA First Annual Masquerade is a judged costuming event, with both 
Technical Judging (i.e. Fursuit Design and Construction) and Performance 
Judging.  The big Masquerade Show will be at noon on Sunday of the con,
and is open to everyone at the con to come and watch all the fun.  During
the show, there will be a non-judged section where anyone (non-suiters
included) can do an act, much like with a traditional Furry Variety Show.

If you are interested in participating in the Masquerade or want more 
information on the event, please be sure to see the following FWA 
LiveJournal Community Post:

  http://community.livejournal.com/furryweekend/65508.html

Hi Link Wolf

Something I have tried and it works well is to make a cut-out of the base of
the paw using heavy duty carpet squares.

You can get them in a variety of colors and they are very durable. If they
start to wear then just make another cut-out. You can also glue pads onto
the for extra visibility. I use thick rubber for these and yes - they do
wear byt you just replace them.

Also the carpet is deosigned to be washable so that any nasties you tread in
can be washed out.

Take Care

Marcwolf

Yup, MFM is also a great con - and especially good for
newcomers to the con scene (it was the second con I
ever attended, right after AC... so quite a shock at
the differences).  

Big problem as of late has of course been the con
timing for me - great for some but I've found Labor
Day weekend to not be as good for going away last few
years.

My body suits go all the way to my jaw line and the heads go down to the
bottom base of my neck to make it look as seamless as possible with out
making them connect. I did not have anything to do with this idea but I
liked it so much that I incorporated it into all of my fursuits after that.
The person that I got the idea from has two realistic fuirsuits one is a
jackalope and the other is a coyote the names that I have access to there
called  "Diego Coyote and Jacko Lopez" I know them from FC05.

I don't think that having ones fursuit head seamless is as important to
toons as it is for realist. But that's for each persons tastes.

It does seem that the east coast does have quite a few cons or get to
gethers. As for the left coast. We have FC which I think is the best.
Califur is more a  reagal con. There is also the FurBBQ for the soCalFurs
but thats a one day event.

As for my self I like my horse boots. It takes weeks for a horses to wear
them out and I weigh like 1/5th of what a horse does and I don't wear them
7/24. So I think that I will never be wearing them out. =b Thou since they
have 5 inch heels there not that comfortable to wear.

For a seamless neck, I make my fursuits so they have  a  turtleneck collar 
that gets tucked up into the head.
There are lots of methods, when in doubt, add more fur!  
For foot paw pads I use foam rubber flooring, The interlocking flooring  
squares for under weight benches, workshops etc. The are avail at lowes and they  
come in different colors. You could also cut up some flip flops. (They are 
meant  to be walked on! )
You will have some 3-D paw pads so therefore when you walk the fur on the  
bottoms of your feet will not really touch the floor too much.
Hope this helps,

Flying is not that much more expensive than the bus and you take a fraction
of the time. The only reason I can see for taking a bus is if your
travailing between two small villages that don't have airports and there not
to far away from each other. Of course the smallest place that I have lived
in has a population of all most 60,000 people and its just outside a city
that has a population of over a million. So I might not quite see things
right.

You may want to look into flying as Donkey suggests.  The con hotel is at 
the airport.

The Seawolves just gave me a call, and Mascot Day is on for their  basketball 
game.  
 
It will be on Sunday February 11, and the event will be Wolfie's birthday  so 
we are all going to help him celebrate.  Game time is 2pm, call time for  
mascots is Noon.
 
For those of you outside NYC metro, Stony Brook U. is in Suffolk County,

Greetings fellow costumers,

Further Confusion and myself have worked professionally with Doug 
Barber, the producer of the Mascot Movie.

In 2004 he brought his cameras to our convention and did a very good 
piece about the amateur / fan side of mascotting in relation to his 
overall film which debuted later that year in the Canidian Independent 
Film Circuit.

In 2005 he was hoping to have a New York agency (managed by a former New 
Line Cinema exec)pick up the film for U.S. distribution.  Due to several 
legal setbacks that avenue had been scrapped.

Doug is hoping that he will be able to produce his DVD for the North 
American market.  But there are still many hurdles.  Professional 
Mascots and the companies that govern them can be a finiky bunch.

So for now, there is no planned release of DVDs.  But you do have two 
options:

1) Go to FC this year and see it on the big screen!  Doug has offered us 
a unique opportunity to show it to the fandom, very possibly the last 
time in this sort of setting.  It will be shown at 4PM on Main Stage 
just after the famed original Critterlympics.  Be sure to plan your day.

http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2007/schedulebyday.php?day=1_20_07

2) You can email Doug or James Phillips (Co-Director / Producer) and see 
what they have to say aboug getting a DVD ...

Heres hoping to see you at Further Confusion ...

I had been wondering, myself, what would work well to use on the bottom of the feet.  I had found some vinal fabric that I estimate to be about 1/16" thick.  This would probabbly work well for short-term use, but I question the lifespan.  (They make vinal floors).  I had been looking for some type of rubber flooring, and maybe the interlocking stuff is what I've been looking for.  (Side note:  I don't recall seeing that at Home Depot)

 Not going to make it to FWA due to transportation issues D: so some furs and I are planning to have our own little furry outing for those who can't make it. 
 
 So I was wondering, what sorts of fun things can fursuiters do around town? I know a lot of malls and stores won't let you in with something covering your head for security issues..so that's out... I was planning putt-putt for an activity, but what else is there? 
 
 Any ideas, or stories would be great. :3
 
 Thanks as always,

Well us at SoCalFurs don't have a problem with fursuit activates. We have
fursuit boiling and minuter golf fursuiting. Just one thing. Call in advance
to have it set up with the owner/manager.

1.  FC06 DVD

We're very sorry to inform everyone that we've discovered a flaw in the
recently received DVDs from 2006 that caused some serious playback
problems in one chapter.  Right now, the manufacturers are producing
corrected DVDs, but we won't be receiving them in time for the convention.
We'd like to assure all the patrons from last year who have already been
shipped the faulty DVD that they will receive new ones as soon as we have
them ourselves.  The same will go for anyone who's purchased a DVD through
our on-line convention store.

Since this delay does mean that we won't have the redone DVD for the
convention, we will instead be making a list of those people who would
like a copy of it when it becomes available.  If you'd like to be put onto
the list, please see the helpful people at the convention store table
during the convention for the sign-up sheets, or you can place an order
through the on-line con store and it will be shipped as soon as we get the
replacement DVDs.


2.  Patron and Sponsor Gifts

Just a quick reminder to all our Patrons and Sponsors. After you get
registered on Thursday, you will be able to pick up your patron and staff
gifts at the Con store outside the dealers room starting Friday morning.
Also, Patrons, please mark your schedule that the Patron Lunch is at 1pm
on Saturday.


3.  Critterlympics

This year, thanks to a very generous bribery package from a charismatic
super-villain who wishes to remain anonymous until the time is right, the
Critterlympics will serve the dual purpose of public entertainment and
minion recruitment.  That's right, talent scouts will infiltrate the
adoring audience to see which team of intrepid critters has the right
stuff to become top-of-the-line henchmen with a chance to get in on the
ground floor of an exciting new nefarious scheme for global domination.
Events such as the Doomsday Relay, the Wicked Hoops of Contortion, the
Other Wicked Hoops of Different Contortion, and more will test your skills
to their limits -- do you have what it takes to assist in the conquest of
today's hip, modern, youth-oriented world?  Sign-ups will begin promptly
at noon on Friday, at the Info Desk.  The slots fill up very fast, so get
there early!  You must be there in person to sign up, unless your
representative can make a very persuasive case in your stead.  We'll also
be accepting volunteers for positions as team coaches and burly enforcers
(bats will be provided).


4.  A/V Staff

A/V tech crew will be accepting applications for staff at-convention for
anyone interested in working specific events on the main stage.
Volunteers can sign up for specific events such as Furry Night Live,
Masquerade, art auction, etc.  We need follow spot operators, camera
operators, and a variety of other positions.  There is no maximum, or
minimum number of shifts, and work is entirely voluntary.  All we ask is
that participants be present for the whole event, including it's
rehearsals.  Anyone may apply, no experience is necessary.  Training will
be offered at rehearsals, and in down-time between events.   Sign-up sheets
will be available in the Oak ballroom beginning Thursday night at 8:00 PM.
Interested parties may also e-mail av at furtherconfusion.org before the
convention to sign up, or ask any questions.


5.  Furly Edition Submission Box Locations

The Furly Edition, your, at con newsletter will have submission boxes
available 24 hours a day at the Info-desk and Convention Operations. If you
have party announcements or anything else you would like considered for
publication, drop them there. The deadline each day is 7pm for the
following days edition.


6.  FNL Announcement

Plans have already been set in motion for Sunday evening's Furry Night
Live! We already have a number of entries registered and planned. If you
have an act and would like to get a jump on paperwork, please contact FNL
Lead Operative Yippee Coyote at fnl at furtherconfusion.org to get an entry
form. These forms should be submitted by email, or can be turned in at
Friday morning's FNL Orientation at 10:30.  A special exception to this
deadline can be granted by prearrangement - if you won't be on-site by
then, or have an act outside the scope of the Masquerade, please contact
the FNL staff via email or stop by the Masquerade orientation Saturday
morning and ask for Yippee Coyote. This year we are offering cash prizes
for the winning entries as judged by audience ballot: $25, $50 and $100
First Prize. 


7.  Airbrush Panel Announcement

Lance Ikegawa and Eric Yee will be again be demonstrating their skill with
the airbrush Sunday at 1PM, and will be looking for a few volunteers to
help with the demonstration.  If you have any fursuit heads you'd like to
see a bit of touching up done on, make sure to bring them to the panel,
which will be held just outside of the convention entrance.  Have an idea
of what you'd like to see, and they will see what they can do to make it a
reality.

14. The Mascot Movie

Further Confusion in cooperation with Doug Barber proudly present ...

THE MASCOT MOVIE (in full color!)

Gather for this one of a kind rare occasion to view what is very possibly
the best film to ever be produced about the world of professional and
amateur mascotting.

Doug Barber came to Further Confusion in 2004 wanting to include the Furry
Fandom in part of his documentary.  With mild reservation we accepted his
offer and from that time never looked back.  Doug has done an excellent job
of bringing the trials and tribulations of sweating out for the glory of a
laugh or brightened day.  With narration by Daniel Stern (City Slickers,
Home Alone, The Wonder Years) we are transported behind the scenes to what
drives us to don the fur, sweat profusely and get taunted by hecklers.
While tongue-in-cheek, the serious sides of costuming are played out in a
very balanced and enjoyable piece.

Doug has offered FurCon exclusive rights to show The Mascot Movie for what
may be the last time in a U.S. setting since his trial market at CaliFur.
So dont miss out on seeing a piece of Furry History!

THE MASCOT MOVIE will be shown on Main Stage ... Saturday January 20th at
4PM just following the world famous Critterlympics!

Be sure to plan your day!

See you at the movies!

"Fursuit boiling" is when you do an 89-degree Renaissance Faire in a 
dragon suit.  Or same dragon in downtown Sacramento where it's 109.
(Not that I know anybody crazy enough to do that).

A *black* dragon fursuit, mind you.  In full sun.  Incorporating all  
sorts of foam and polyfill padding.  No, fortunately we don't know  
anyone that crazy.

So what's this other fursuit sport?  Minotaur golf?

  Well us at SoCalFurs don't have a problem with fursuit activates. We have fursuit boiling and minuter golf fursuiting. Just one thing. Call in advance to have it set up with the owner/manager.

Oi, I did a 20+ minute soccer game in full costume for UC Hayward with 
some of the local group ... it was a half time special ... 105 degrees.

That's where falling over in jest was actually like taking a break. 
Running for that period of time was like living in the den of Hades himself.

Then there was the halftime show for the Final Four at Stanford ... 
playing basketball on a regulation court for even 10 minutes ... bout 
died.  But man its worth it ... guess it depends on your insanitly 
level.  Mine can be high at times.  Whee.

The is a couple of good things doing that in fursuit. First moving
that fast you should stay cool. Secant with a fursuit head on you wont
be able to see the ground. So the people that are afraid of heights
wont be afraid.

Maybe I should do that so people can see a flying donkey that's not
animated. =b Just hope that I don't have the... stuff scared out of me
and you are below to receive the falling... stuff. Maybe there are
reasons why donkeys dont fly.

I think we can come up with a better name for the product than a "fursuit boiler."  My vote is for the "Personal, portable, sauna suit."

Subject: FL: Attaching teeth to a foam head
Message-ID: <45A878D4.6080401@growf.com>

I'm looking into making some simple little sculpey teeth for the head 
I'm working on right now, and I'm wondering how anyone else has attached 
teeth to a foam head.  I'm just planning on a couple little fangs, not a 
whole jaw of teeth, so I need a way to attach individual teeth to the head.

Hotgluing sculpey to foam doesn't sound like it'd be strong enough.

Best idea that's come to mind (I think someone recommended this at some 
point, but I can't remember who) is to embed something in the tooth to 
give it an attachment point (just a small loop of wire or something), 
then sew that into the fur.

Anyone have a better method?

When I remade and replaced the two canine fangs for my head a few years
ago, I sculpted teeth with a root that was essentially a mirror image of
the exposed tooth part.  I then made a small hole in the foam of the
lower jaw, squirted some hot glue into the hole, and inserted the root
end into that glue filled hole.  The teeth are still in the jaw solidly.

  There are lots of methods, when in doubt, add more fur!  
  For foot paw pads I use foam rubber flooring, The interlocking flooring   squares for under weight benches, workshops etc. The are avail at lowes and they   come in different colors. 
  

I found the interlocking foam squares  mentioned above.  While they may work for paw pads, I question how  well they may work for the entire bottom of the foot.  Has anyone  tried that?
  
  I think the Critter Costuming book mentioned using sheets of Vulcanized  rubber for the bottom of feet.  I have looked around quite a bit  to try and find something like this, although I havn't had much  luck.  I have called some stores that specialize in  flooring.  About half of them didn't have anyting like that.   The other half had a rubber weight room flooring, but it was expensive  and had to be special ordrered.  Has anyone found a good source  for rubber sheeting that would work for the entire bottom of the foot?
  
  Thanks

Look online for crepe soling - its used to make shoe soles so it  
should wear like normal shoes.  It comes in flat sheets, usually  
black and white are easy to get.  I bought some about 8 years ago  
online but I have no idea from whom.  Just google crepe soling and  
see what you come up with.

I know Delchers Leather In florida carries the sheets of sloe metarial and 
if he doesnt have it in stock,he can get it. I bought some off of him when i 
was down there. It was alittle pricey,but i think he'll ship it where it 
needs to go.The # is 904 641 5191. I know he uses it to make flip flops,so 
it should be good for foot paws!!

Orchard Supply Hardware sells sheet rubber material in
their flooring section.  At my local stores it's back
where all their chains and cables are stored, as
that's where they have a table for cutting.

Working with Sculpy is definately difficult ... Pompeii's nose and my 
realistic raccoon's jaw set are both Sculpy..

I used a ton of hot glue for Pompeii, and I drilled holes in the jaw and 
sewed them to the frame of the moving jaw.   This is only because I was 
too lazy to use epoxy ... which if you dont mind using a 2 part and cure 
time ... it should work great.

For my horse suit, I actually used some novelty erasers that I found
in a party supply store.  They were apple shaped, flat, but rather
thick, so I cut the sides off to square them off, painted them with
oil-based primer, and hot-glued them to the head's plastic mesh.

 That's some cool stuff (if only my city actually HAD activities like that!), but it wasn't really what I was looking for. I was talking more about...how to describe it...non-community-or-holiday-related activities? Just everyday "I feel like throwing on a suit and having fun with friends" kind of activities, like going bowling and minigolfing as mentioned. I like the zoo idea though, I'll have to check with the Tulsa Zoo and the Aquarium to see if its okay to walk around in-suit there. :3

    -- CHAIRO:  ... could do bungee jumping

    -- LINK WOLF:  ... Any other ideas?

    Bungi jumping I have not tried.  but but I have
persued other werewolf appearance oportunities:

    1 - birthday parties,

    2 - 'Boo at the ZOO' (halloween season)

    3 - Nativity reenactament at church (Christmas.  I
played a wolf seeking the Star of Bethelehem - after a
repentanc stiring encounter with an angel (Acts 9:
3-4.  Alma 27: 11 [in 'Book of Mormon']))

    4 - Conduit (freely roaming halls of hotel with other
characters and critters during science fiction
convention)

    5 - Dog park ribbon cutting (I posed for photos with
a frizbee in my jaws).  

    6 - Forth of July Parade!  (98 degrees.  I walked
entire route without fainting, waving my flag,
dancing, and exclaiming "Hap-py birth-day A-mer-i-ca!"

    5 - Haunted Canyon Train (riding scenic excursion ,
Halloween)

    6 - howls (picnic, LARP, and napping in hamick in a
remote forest camground),

    7 - Kid's safety fair (seeking ear scratches - and
maybe a fire engine ride),

    8 - Neighborhood Watch Street Party (carnival for
families protected by baricades police set up for us. 
I led a parde of kids on decorated tricyces and such)

    9 - premixing sour dough pancake batter (with my wolf
head on) so it can ferment over night.

    10 - Saint Patricks day parade.

    11 - Santa Claus parade (arrival at local mall with
other mascots.}

    12 - TRAX light rail station ribon cutting (Talked
with mayor, Kept out of camera by security, but took
home a brownie!).

>_> Ice skating in-suit could be pretty dangerous, mainly because
falling on ice = much pain + risk of serious injury. Suits are baggy
and hamper movement, and with the bad peripheral vision in most
fursuits, zooming skaters might knock into you or cause you to fall.
It would probably be harder to get up, and (worst case scenario) if
you needed medical attention a suit would def. prove to be a problem!

What about going out shopping, or for a walk in a local park? Dress
your 'suit up in some running gear and take a mock-jog around your
neighborhood? Football/baseball/othersport party? It's fun to even
walk around in character for a few hours (go food shopping, if it's
okay with the store, getting a coffee, stuff like that)

I went sledding the other day in my fursuit.  I didn't wear the whole thing

will this movie be only viewed at the con?

It will not be available for purchase at FC or anywhere for that matter, especially in the USA for the forseeable future, all due to liscensing and legal clearance issues involving many of the mascots portrayed in the film.
 
I was one of the first fursuiters interviewed in the film when they came here to New York City and I still have not seen it yet.....

As I'm in the process of building a panther for a local Footbal team, I have 
had no luck finding a dark navy Blue that's decent quality.

I'm in South Australia, and have tried our main importers without success. 
found a royal blue, but not what I had in mind.

does anyone know where, or have seen any recently.

Thanks Peoples,

Luke.

HI Luke
we use Monterey Fabrics. they offer bolt and by the cut.. The fur is great 
quality... and the people great to work with. I do find some colors are just 
not as good as others. the long and med pile are the best short is still 
good.  They have animal prints and all kinds. They are in Janesville WI and 
will ship anywhere. Good luck..
Karen.

It is with sad news to learn that Kimber Fox passed away last night.  At least he is no longer in the pain he had been suffering the last few years, as 
his battle with cancer had not been very good.

To a fellow Floridian, and Fursuiter, you will be missed, seeing your presence in the walls of conventions, and other parties.

To his close friends and family, especially Blazer Racoon, be strong, and know he is in peace.  

I personally know I have met him at many outings, and regret I never took the time to get to know him..  Makes one think..  Try to get to know someone 
you see, but are afraid to approach to get to know better.

I like that idea. Is there a furry convection or individual that would be
willing to store and display fursuits of furrys that have passed on? Heck
there is a museum for everything else. Why not one for fursuits. The museum
could also have art and story's from those furrys that are not fursuiters
but where still people that furthered furry.

Would someone be willing to write a bio and description for his character
? And send me pictures of his fursuit ?
I could then include them in both the fursuit archive and the fursuit
database.
So that he stays in our memories forever.

Hi Folks.

Sadly I never knew or spoke with Kimberfox.

However a wise man once said that our legacy is build on the lives we have
touched on our mortal journey.
Whilst we tread this Earth we can do good or bad.
Give freely or take.
Leave joy or unhappiness.
That is our choice.

path he chose in life.  And the fursuiting community and his family are his
legacy. May that live on.

Timduru's idea of a Fursuit Memorium for those who have finally shed the
fake fur to become their true form is a wonderful idea. And it would be a
tribute to the fursuiting community in general.

Yake care all

Only thign I seemed to find was this:

http://cgi.ebay.com/MEGA-HUGE-SUNGLASSES-FUN-DISGUISE-COSTUME-COOL-NEW_W0QQitemZ290077936533QQcmdZViewItem

Whilst this is only one item, she appears to have a store online so might be 
worth while checking out.

also:

http://www.costumecraze.com/CLWN63.html

http://www.scavengeinc.com/jumbo-sunglasses-p-3689.html

Found doing a search for 'clown sunglasses' or 'jumbo sunglasses' on google 
gave some good results.

Hope this helps yappy :)

Any good novelty or joke shop should sell them. There is one in my home town
that would sell them. If need be, I can purchase a pair and ship them to
you.

Walmart's toy section usually has them for 88 cents a pair in the aisle with 
the bubbles and cheapo stuff like that.  They have hearts, stars, clovers... 
i can't remember what else...  I've never seen horseshoes, though.

Message-ID: <260373.29497.qm@web59203.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

There are two upcoming fursuiting events in the New
York and Connecticut areas - and we very much need
more fursuiters.

1.  Penguin Plunge, a Special Olympics charity
fundraiser that takes place in Middletown, Connecticut
- right next to where the first FurFright convention
was held.  Interact with everyone attending the event,
including making some autistic children smile.  Takes
place on Saturday, March 3rd from about 1030am to
1230pm.  More info can be found here:
http://community.livejournal.com/fursuit_gigs/27521.html
Respond to the post or email me personally if
interested.

2. Kids Expo, parade / meet and greet at Poughkeepsie,
NY.  The main event is the parade on Sunday April
15th, afterwards we interact with the crowds in the
Civic Center.  If interested, can also participate in
meet and greet on saturday the 14th.  Meetup for
parade begins at 11am.  Meet and greet for both days
begins around noon until 4 or 5pm.
More info can be found here:
http://freakylynx.livejournal.com/373813.html


This is the second year fursuiters have participated
at both events, we were very well received the first
year for both events and I'd like to make sure that
continues.

-Freaky Lynx

Try www.clownsupplies.com or any local clown supply place. Also for
great foam props try searching for Peachie Keene foam props. He can make
anything out of foam, and is fairly reasonable!

Message-ID: <20070209.012830.-1047149.9.dlely@juno.com>

Fursuiters and Friends:

Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday is coming up quickly on the 20th of this month
and once again the merchants of Olvera Street are inviting fursuiters to
come on out to help celebrate.  This public event will be held at El
Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, home of the world famous
Olvera Street, the birthplace of the City of Los Angeles, in Downtown Los
Angeles.

This year the celebration begins at 8:30 AM with children?s activities
and various street talent including us crazy fursuiters!  For the most
part, regular tourists, business folks from downtown, and bussed in
school children will be visiting and participating.  This year the
children?s activities will wrap up around 1:00 PM and unfortunately there
will be no afternoon or evening activities as in previous years.

We will be roaming around meeting and greeting the children, families,
tourists, and merchants plus participating in the parade around 12:00
noon. 
You can arrive/leave whenever you would like and if you're fursuiting
you're welcome to suit up as little or as much as you want - no pressures
or requirements!  As in the past escorts are very much welcomed to help
us fursuiters.

If you are interested in participating please notify me privately
off-list at dlely at juno.com.

For more information about, directions to, and maps of Olvera Street
check out: http://www.olvera-street.com/  and

Howdy all.

Ok, I am working on a new project and am in need of some help.

1.  Can anyone suggest a good, quick disconnect male and female plug to use 
to hook up a 9.6v OR a 12v dc rechargeable battery to a fan with a switch? 
Battery size will be determined once I see how each blows and at what rate 
and how long each lasts.  What I have are 2 computer fans, one standard type 
and one side-blow that Ill be attaching to my suit in 2 different places. 
Each fan will have its own battery and on/off switch.  These will both be 
attached to a single 1/8th inch thick piece of plastic mesh, with 2 tails 
running off, one to each fan.  This should provide a suitable base to attach 
them to and to keep things from moving around.  So Im in need of an easy, 
secure way to connect / disconnect the power sources from each fan.  Ive 
seen microphone or audio cable quick connects, the metal tubes with 3 prongs 
inside and a curly tail headed to each source.  Any other ideas?  Radio 
Shack was absolutely no help whatsoever.  They have various switches but 
their staff had no idea when I asked them questions.

2.  What gauge wiring should I have going from either the 9.6v or 12v DV 
batteries to the switch and then to the plug?  Currently it looks to be 20 
gauge from the batteries.  It came preassembled with this wiring, but I just 
want to be sure before I put a load on it.

As for what Im making, you'll just have to wait for AC to find out.  But 
trust me in that, when you see it, you will not believe it.  :D

RAGGS (www.raggs.com) is looking for one performer in the D.C. area to be Raggs.  This is a meet and greet, not a show like most gigs, because they have new suits this year and the only suit that will be ready in time for this gig is Raggs.  This will be the White House Easter Egg Roll.  If you are interested, or just want more information, contact Jason Priest at jpriest at raggs.com.
 
FYI, I have asked Jason about CA gigs this year, and am waiting to hear back from him.

Probably the best bet would be Radio Shack Cat # 270-026 quick  
disconnect  -OR-  a 2 pin "Molex" type connector. Radio Shack cat #  
274-222.

They both show up on Radio Shaft's website, so they may be available  
in the store.

Hope this helps

Oh... 20 gauge wire would be PLENTY for a pair of fans. 22 or 24  
would be find too.
Those things don't pull much current.

I use two battery holders that each hold 4xAA batteries.  They have
standard 9V-style terminals on top of the holders.  So I just wire up
two 9V battery connectors and hook up the battery holders to them.  I
also use a switch, though.

Another good connector is the type 9.6v remote-control cars 
use.  RadioShack # 23-445.  You can get 9.6v rechargeable battery packs 
with this connector already attached.  Just plug it in and you're done.  A 
major advantage of this connector is that all Radio Shacks sell the R/C 
batteries with that connector, as well as hobby shops and some toy stores, 
so you can get replacements no matter where you are.

If you go this route, be certain to include a fuse in your setup.  Shorted 
battery packs are really nasty!

Yeah, that's what I have in mine too, and I run two smallish computer
fans, though I don't have a switch, i'ts a very convenient way to wire
it up, I think, the way you did it, Blackberry.

This pic shows what I used for powering my fans.

the helmet.  http://www.foxwolfart.furtopia.org/Foxwolf%20comes%20to%20life/Head%20Construction/head%20const%2043.JPG

Yeah I had considered getting the rc packs, but the company i purchased my 
battery packs from gave me a really great deal on 2 packs for less than the 
price of one, when they heard what I was making with them.  Surprisingly, 
each battery ended up being roughly the same price as an 8 pack of regular 
alkaline batteries, only in NiMH.  I got 2 sets of 2 batteries.  One set is 
9.6v NiMH but without a plug attached, wires were end capped. The other set 
is 12v NiMH, also with the ends capped.

Also, this way, at the end of the night, I can just plug them in to the wall 
and they'll be fully charged by morning.

Thanks for the ideas!
Lucky

Hi.
I used to use the 9v style battery pack plues, and also used for a while the
2 pin molex style plugs. I finally settles on these after a lot of trial and
error.

Nowadays I use the R/C style of plugs.

When you sweat you release salts and ureic (sic) acids.  The heaver duty
R/C plucs might corrode a little but will last in the long run. Plus the
wires on them are also heavy duty and can take the stress. No problems with
the curren rating here either - you can run about 10 amps through these.

Now - With the two pin molex - it is possible to reverse the connections.
Done that once and destroyed my eye blinking circuit.

With the 9V connectors - I have NEVER found one that was robust enought.
After a short time the leads would break and  the fan is an essential part
of the suit.

 Hope this helps.

I've had my suits for a lot longer than a short time now.  I've had no
failure of the 9V connectors.  I don't see why they would fail unless
you let them hang loose and hang the battery weight on them or
something.  They shouldn't be expected to fail any more often than any
other small gauge wire.

The great thing about 12V worth of AAs is that, with two 60mm case
fans, I get about 16 hours of continuous run time, plenty for any
convention.

Hello all..allow me to introduce myself. I'm Johara and my fursona is a 
female Saluki (dog), no hybrid. I have been lurking since I joined your 
group, but have keeping tabs on the events posted. I live in Alberta, Canada 
and sadly, we don't have nearly the number of furry events and cons that 
americans do.....which leaves us travelling a lot. Fursuiting at Mardi Gras 
sounds like a blast!! I'm hoping to attend AC, Dragoncon or Conifur as I 
missed FC *whines*. Me and a fellow fur here in Calgary are attempting to 
set up our second con which piggybacks Conversion (Calgary Science Fiction 
and Fantasy Society). In addition, we will be incorporating the furry 
olympics into this event. Conversion is usually held around September. I 
will keep this list updated.
I'm currently working on my second fursuit.....the first can be seen at 
www.joharasaluki.deviantart.com in the scraps section. The second in still 
in pieces. Hope I get the opportunity to meet you all in the near future. 
Now, I must get back to work!

Message-ID: <45CFEE3F.6040103@pawpet.org>

Florida's furry arts and performance convention is back for another
spin, and this time, we're bringing the fun to the First Coast! Megaplex
2007 will be held on March 2-4, 2007, at the Wyndham Jacksonville
Riverwalk, in Jacksonville, Florida.

We're getting closer and closer! Here's the latest news!

PRE-REG CLOSING SOON!

If you haven't pre-registered for the convention, time is running out!
Not only will it be more expensive at the door, but you may miss out on
a special premium we're offering our members this year, as a thank you
for all of your support.

We're going to be handing out special Megaplex 2007 MUGS! These glass
mugs are great for your favourite beverage...and, they'll feature a
special design by Herbie! However, we'll be judging how many mugs to
order by the number of pre-registrations we get. If you pre-reg, you
*will* get a mug. If you register at the con, we may or may not have any
left...so, if you want to guarantee yourself one of these special
keepsakes, pre-reg now!

Head to http://ppmp.info/mp06/reg.php and register now! We'll be closing
pre-reg on February 19th (the day after Furry Weekend Atlanta ends).

T-SHIRTS GALORE!

While you're pre-registering, why not grab yourself one of our official
Megaplex 2007 t-shirts! The shirts will be light grey, and feature
artwork by our guest of honour, Mike Kazaleh!

(Visit http://community.livejournal.com/megaplex/28285.html to see the
t-shirt art!)

T-shirts are only $12 for sizes S-2XL. By pre-ordering, you will
guarantee yourself a shirt - and the shirts will be more expensive at
the con, as well as available only in limited numbers. We went through
our remaining inventory of 2006 shirts in something like five minutes
once the extras went on sale - don't miss out this year!

LET'S MAKE A DEAL(er's Room)!

Also, if you want to get a dealer's room table, you can take care of
that when you register, as well! Tables are still available, first come
first served, for $40 a table (limit 2).

NOTE : If you are registered dealer and have *not* received a message
from Carl Fox with important information, please contact him directly on
mp-ceo at pawpet.org.

ALSO : If you have already pre-registered and want a t-shirt or dealer's
table now, contact mp-registration at pawpet.org or mp-ceo at pawpet.org for
assistance. We'll make sure you're counted properly!

LET'S MEET OUR GUEST OF HONOUR!

Megaplex 2007 is happy to announce that Mike Kazaleh will be joining us
as Guest of Honour this year! Mike is a professional animator and comics
artist; old-school furry fans will remember his comics work on "The
Adventures of Captain Jack" (Fantagraphics), and "Mean Green Bondo
Machine" and "The Suit" (MU Press). He has also drawn "Ren and Stimpy"
for Marvel, "Cow and Chicken" for DC Comics, and "The Mighty Mutanimals"
for Archie Comics, and is currently working on "Futurama" for Bongo
Comics and "Camp Lazlo" for DC.

Animation-wise, his credits include "The New Adventures of Mighty
Mouse", "Tiny Toon Adventures", and "The Simpsons"; more recently, he
has worked on "Krypto the Superdog", "Johnny Test", and "Hi Hi Puffy Ami
Yumi". He was also a storyboard artist for the recent release, "The Ant
Bully".

Please join us in welcoming Mike to Megaplex 2007!

CARE IS BACK...

...and we're happy, as always, to support the fine work they do helping
rescue animals in Central Florida. We'll be having our charity auction
again this year. If you have items you'd like to donate to help us raise
money for C.A.R.E., contact Carl Fox at mp-ceo at pawpet.org.

WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR #1?

It's time to play! This year, we're working up a Game Show theme that is
sure to entertain...especially with our members at the contestants! Keep
an eye on the Events page at http://www.ppmp.info for more details on
the specific games, and how you can play! There'll be fursuit-specific
games, as well as games for all our members to join in on.

It wouldn't be a game show theme without the return of a crowd favourite
- the Gong Show! Our annual variety-show-with-a-twist is always
entertaining...play along, even if your act isn't that great; sometimes
it's better to perform and have been gonged than never to have performed
at all! Contact Josh Strom at mp-variety at pawpet.org if you'd like to
perform in the show.

Whose Line Is It Anyway? Our improvisational stars', that's who...and
that could include you! The improv returns for another spin in 2007.

Megaplex also welcomes the return of a couple of guys who always keep us
in stitches - Uncle Kage, and 2, the Ranting Gryphon will be back for
2007, with their unique stories and comedy. Kage and 2 often test out
new material for Anthrocon here first, so come hear what's up!

DJ Rory will be with us, as well, spinning the tunes for a
fursuit-friendly dance! That's only one of the dances we'll have this
year...and (weather permitting) we'll be dancing on outside deck,
overlooking the St. Johns River!

There'll be mystery amongst the merriment...here's a hint. You'll want
to be at the Opening Ceremonies this year... ;)

For our fursuiting and puppeteering members, Santa Fox is working those
tracks this year. If you enjoy what he has planned at FWA, you'll *love*
what we'll be doing at Megaplex!

Plus, we'll be bringing back the late-night showing of the Rocky Horror
Picture Show, a smash hit from 2006! (Yes, we're bending the rating a
little for this one - badges will be checked at the door, and no minor
badges will be admitted.)

If you have any other ideas for a panel or event that fits into our
theme for 2007, drop John Cole a line at mp-programming at pawpet.org . We
want your feedback on exactly what you want to see at the convention,
and we want to get with folks who would like to run said panels and
events. Megaplex is ultimately the members' convention, so help make it
the best it can be!

We're always on the lookout for volunteers, as well. Drop us a note if
you'd like to help out in March.

HAVE YOU VISITED THE WEBSITE LATELY?

What can you do on http://www.ppmp.info/ ? Well, you can register for
the convention, order your con t-shirt, reserve your dealer's room
table(s), and purchase con book advertisements and personals! Not to
mention, we'll be updating the site regularly with news and notes to get
you ready for the con.

Also, keep an eye on our "megaplex" community on LiveJournal, for
additional information from not only the staff of Megaplex, but our
members as well! That site is http://megaplex.livejournal.com/ .

STAY TUNED!

Keep an eye on http://www.ppmp.info/ and
http://megaplex.livejournal.com/ for the latest news and information,
and please do not hesitate to drop us a line at
megaplex-feedback at pawpet.org (or to the chairman directly at
mp-ceo at pawpet.org) if you have suggestions or questions regarding the
convention.

Also, please join our dedicated mailing list for Megaplex! Information
on joining can be found at

Not sure if Radio Shack still carries it but they had a kit to fox RC 
car batteries, has both the male and female ends. Something like 
that is your best bet so you can use RC car battery packs. Their 
easy to come by and easy to get chargers and the like for.. 

Make sure you use a fuse in your curcuit, masks get hot and 
sweaty even with fans in them and the moisture could short 
something out, shorted out nicads or nimh batterys have a 
tendency to explode and that would not be good for you at all! I 
also reconnend using shrink wrap tubing and soldering any wire 
joints.. I found out early on that the salt from your sweat will 
corrode the copper in wires.. 

If Radio Shack doesn't have the connectors you need try your local 
RC car hobbie shop, such places tend to be a little more expensive 
than radio shack would be but would definatly have what you 
need..

As for estimating the time your fan/battery will run, its fairly easy, 
say you have a 1000mah battery, and a 100ma fan, it'll last up to 
10hrs in a perfect world.. My setups usually use two 7.2v batteries 
in series, gives ya 14.4v to the fans and gives them a little extra 
oomph... where size is a factor, a 9.6v RC pack is good enough for 
a single fan, they don't usually have enough of amperage to run 
two fans for more than a few hours..

There's some pix of the electronics in some of my masks on my 
web page, fursuits.wereanimal.net. check Keesar and BBW v3, I 
think there might be some more pix in some of the other ones..

Hope it helps!

Something else that I do.. is use 5V fans.

That way you can drive them using 4 x AA nicads and they can last a long
time. In an emergency you can swap to  Alkaline cells.

Nowadays you can get AA that got upto 3000mAh - which in my suit with 2 fans
and a blinking eye system will last atleat 3 plus hours or more.

I have also seen sub C cells that will go upto 9000mAh - and these I will be
using when I get all of the R/C servo's in my suit.


Hopes this helps

A 9v battery will run a 12v computer fan.  Maybe not as high as if you 
used 12v worth of batteries, but it does work.. and you can get little 
9v battery clips that are plastic and can be attached inside the head. 
Have the air from the fan blow the air OUT, not in.. this will pull the 
warm air out of the head (mouth or other opening) and cooler air will 
circulate in though any other openings in the head.

Better yet, have two fans, one to blow on your face and the other to blow the air out.  When I only had one fan that blew out, it helped, but having the second fan blow on your face helps to evaporate sweat, keeping you even cooler.

Hi Jazmyn

I have 2 fans - one pushing air in from the muzzle and the other sucking the
hot air out above the ear.

The muzzle fan is a 2.5cm (1 inch) laptop fan and that keeps a constant
breeze of cooler air on my face, plus it helps dispell any CO2 buildup
around the mouth and nostrils.

The other fan is a 40cm (1.75? inch) VGA cooler fan and that does a good job
of getting the hot air out.

The CO2 aspect is pretty important. Any build up of that and you start to
feel cramped, claustrofobic, and stressed.  Thats why when I am putting fans
in I make sure that the user is the first place the air is getting to.

I have done several fan retrofits on various suits now and I have not had
any problems.

Take Care

I'm going to travel by air from Seattle to Atlanta for Furry Weekend
Atlanta in two days.  Usually, my fursuit lives in a big plastic bin
and travels to FC or Howloween in the boot of my car.  Can anyfur
suggest some good ways of moving a fursuit (head, tail, bodysuit,
paws) easily and cheaply through the airline system?

Thanks!

Action packers or big blue bins seem to be one popular way. I've used  
the blue bin before. I secure the top with removable zip-ties thru  
holes drilled along the lip. I tape extras inside the lid in case the  
zips get cut off. And, I also have "BAGGAGE" in huge letters on the  
side.

Another option is a hockey duffel. Those things are huge.

A steamer trunk is also optional. These days they can weigh less than 9kgs,
and are sturdy as anything!

I know of two good ways, depending on how much you want to spend:

ActionPakers by RubberMaid: 
http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html?asin=B00002N6SQ
These are fairly inexpensive, with snap-lock lids, though you'll want to 
tape them shut for extra security, or maybe even zip ties.  They are also 
the maximum allowable size for airlines without being charged an oversize 
fee.  Based on my experience, and the experience of other fursuiters I know, 
ActionPackers tend to end up being opened and searched by TSA more often, 
but if that's not a concern, then this could be a good choice.

Large hardshell suitcase, like the Samsonite - Cruisair 400 Series 29" 
Spinner Upright Suitcase: 
http://www.amazon.com/Samsonite-Hardside-Spinner-Luggage-Upright/dp/B000GDNRBU/sr=8-4/qid=1171332621/ref=pd_bbs_4/105-4235962-2852436?ie=UTF8&s=apparel
This suitcase has a built-in lock that is TSA approved, moves easily on the 
wheels and his rigid, so your fursuit is protected.  The down side is that 
it is more expensive, like about $160 or so, but I've been quite happy with 
mine.

There are probably quite a few other options in suitcases too.  Hope this 
helps.

You sure about that? Those airline baggage gorillas nearly demolished 
two of my trunks. The first was one of those things that college kids 
have, though a little larger. The brass edging is gone or bent in places 
and the top and bottom have been pushed in. Another trunk, though smaller, 
had the plastic and metal edging in places ripped off. They're retired...

The Container Store and Walmart should have those black plastic wheeled 
trunks. Mine had the wheels ripped off on the first flight.

http://www.containerstore.com/

They should have those metal trunks. Let's see them gorillas try to 
demolish *THOSE!*

You still have to make sure you're under the measurement and weight 
limits, otherwise you're going to be nailed by expensive fees. Then again, 
someone, I think Yappy, mentioned that he paid a skycap to bypass those 
limits. Check the airline pages for that info.

I keep a small handcart in my trunks. It's pretty funny to see some people 
get jealous looks when I fold up mine and stick it in there.

There should be some more on this in the fursuit Wiki/FAQ like what to 
expect and what can be used.

there's lots of ideas on fan setups. for me it's always seemed to 
work better to have two fans, both blowing fresh air into the mask.. 
the hot air goes out of the fur or under the mask around your neck..

Some like to draw the air into the mask by having the fans blow out 
but keep in mind, it's most likely going to draw the air from under 
the mask, right over your warm body, warming the air some..

in my fursuit 101 sigs I give at AC I always tell everyone to use 
whatever works best for you.. there's really no wrong way to add 
colling to your mask, cept to not have any at all.. even one small 
fan can let you spend hours longer in suit from the reilef it brings.. 
Fursuits are fun but are HOT inside! Just the way it is...

I've taken an alternative approach.  Most fursuit bits (body, hand
and foot paws, tail, undersuit) are typically no more delicate than
everyday clothes.  Often the head is the only issue.  I bought a sturdy
plastic box just big enough for the head and pack this in an ordinary
holdall surrounding it with all the soft parts of the suit and other
clothes.

I suspect that airline baggage handlers treat hard shell cases and
boxes as a personal challenge to see what damage _can_ be done to
them.

As for closures, rather than cable ties, and having to pack more cable
ties inside with instructions for the inspectors to re-use them, I
take another low-tech approach: string - its re-usable!

No trouble at all on my recent trans-atlantic trip to FC.

Something I found, by accident, was these: http://www.luggageonline.com/product.cfm?product_ID=6105

This unit expanded still fits within airline regulation size, and it expands deeper than any other suitcase I have found, which works well for my 
heads.  And since it looks like a normal suitcase, I've noticed it is often not fondled by TSA, and if it is opened, they generally know how to 
re-close it..  and they are eaiser to pull through the airport even 2 of them, which is what I have.

Action packers were just too cumbersome to fly with alot..  I put wheels on one of my action packers to make it a lil biit easier to move around in the 
airport.  They always wanted to double take and charge extra for them, until you proved they were in size, and often they made me sign a waiver that 
stated since they were not actual suitcases that they took -NO- responsibility on damages.  TSA almost always opened them, and since they are 
designed for pad locks, if the TSA does not correctly put tie wraps back into them 
correctly after opening them (They tend to put them just on the padlock eylet, which since the padlock body is used to hold the red handles shut, and 
the tie wraps don't, I've had the horror experience of watching my action packer come up on the baggage clain without a lid, and drenched in rain since 
it was raining outside on the tarmac, and the lid come up a few pieces later.  Nothing makes your heart stop like seeing your expensive costume strewn 
all about the airport, and if you signed that waiver..  they tell you tough s**t.

Costly, but much safer for the suit, is to make plans ahead of time to pack and
ship the suit via FedEx or UPS.  Most hotels will accept and hold packages
shipped if the room is in your name.  You will need to call the concierge desk,
first, to make arrangements. (I've done this when shipping presentation
materials for a conference)

If the room is not in your name, you will need to jump through some hoops,
namely contacting the person signing for the room and asking them to accept
delivery of your package.  They can then contact the Hotel.

And finally, if you know someone that is planning on to the Con and is willing
to add your suit to their luggage, simply ship the suit to them.

None of these help you right now.  Best of luck with packing the suit with your
checked luggage and have a good time at FWA.

Costly is an understatement.  I shipped 2 boxes of fursuits to FC.  Going there they cost me $30 each, insured for $1500 each.

To ship them out via the UPS store in the hotel..  $90 each.  Painful experience.   The hotel last year had done my shipping for me (I don't know if 
they still offered the service, since I was told there was a UPS store..)  but last year they were only like $50 each to return..  So beware of the UPS 
store x.x

But shipping them, if you have some direct way to bill to UPS or FEDEX ground, definetly makes it easier than the hassel of dragging them through the 
airport.

The first thing that came to mind for me was a Drum case.  The snare  
drum cases in our band look to be the perfect size for the average  
fursuit head but I'm sure there are plenty of different choices as  
far as sizes and price ranges out there at marching band / music  
stores.  I bet you can get them with wheels on the bottom and fur  
sure they are darn near indestructible -you'd just want to rig up the  
inside for a custom fit.
Cheers!

after having several people tell me their packages / suits disapeared with 
UPS or otherwise delayed, they dont seem any more reliable then the airport, 
and much more costly.  Least with the airports it's out of my sight for the 
least duration possible, little harder to cary but most airports it's just a 
short distance form the luggage area to the door.

I;ve flown a few times with my action packers, opened twice, but i taped 
them no tie wraps. and they always came back in one peice.  The last tiem 
however, they opened it for inspection, it didn't make the same flight as 
me, so it arrived by currier the next day, now that was scary...esepecially 
as it has peices from BOTH suits in it as well as my sketch book. So if you 
have multipel suits, watch how you pack them.  What may fit better, may cost 
you more in the long run should somthing happen.

I have 2 fans - one pushing air in from the muzzle and the other sucking the
hot air out above the ear.

The muzzle fan is a 2.5cm (1 inch) laptop fan and that keeps a constant
breeze of cooler air on my face, plus it helps dispell any CO2 buildup
around the mouth and nostrils.

The other fan is a 40cm (1.75? inch) VGA cooler fan and that does a good job
of getting the hot air out.

The CO2 aspect is pretty important. Any build up of that and you start to
feel cramped, claustrofobic, and stressed.  Thats why when I am putting fans
in I make sure that the user is the first place the air is getting to.

I have done several fan retrofits on various suits now and I have not had
any problems.

<div>From my experience with RAGGS, which requires dancing in suit on an outside stage (and I have done shows in 90-100 degree weather), I felt like I couldn't breathe and was about to pass out (even though I didn't).&nbsp; So whether it be my own suit or a company suit I perform in, it's now always BYOF (bring your own fans).&nbsp; I just duct tape them inside the head.&nbsp; They stay in place and once removed, there's no evidence there was ever a fan there.&nbsp; At FC just last month, having the fans allowed me to be in suit at the fursuit dance for about two hours.</div>

<div>P.S.&nbsp; It's ironic that I'm even a fursuiter (and those who know me personally know how much suiting I do), because I normally hate being hot.&nbsp; I kick off the covers at night, and have the AC or fan on full blast.&nbsp; Glacier Tek inserts (<A href="http://www.glaciertek.com">www.glaciertek.com</A> or <A href="http://www.coolvest.com">www.coolvest.com</A>) are another "must have" for fursuiting.</div>

&gt; A 9v battery will run a 12v computer fan.  Maybe not as high as if you

This year at FC I arrived with 2 suits and needed to leave with 3 so  
I opted to ship one home.  The UPS store at the hotel charged me $22 
+tax for a 24"x24"x24" empty box.  Then they quoted me $77 for ground  
shipping with $600 insurance.  FEDEX had a box for $10.50 and  
shipping for $40 with the same insurance.  I already bought the box  
but I saved big on the shipping.  Also, the UPS web site quoted the  
same price on the shipping so the UPS store doesn't have a shipping  
markup, and the FEDEX store had the same price as the website.

How to get to the nearest FEDEX store?  Go to the end of the FC hotel  
overflow parking lot.  You know where the white gates are?  The FEDEX  
drop off center is in the building at that end of the parking lot.   
Next year if you need to ship something, take the walk over to FEDEX.

Hey all!

Just got back from FWA (frikkin awesome btw!!) and diving into  
constructing my suit.  Got a good pair of scissors and lots of muslin  
but the darn Simplicity pattern that was widely recommended at the  
Fursuit construction 101 panel -where do you find it?  our local  
walmart has one for little kids and the McCall's catalog had a lion  
that looked cool but I was not sure at all if I should get that since  
I didn't hear it mentioned at the panel.  Please, if anyone knows  
what number the recommended Simplicity one is now -let me know and  
I'll go hunt it down and jump on it right away.  Thanks!!

I couldn't find that one either, but I found a jumpsuit sleeper
pattern thing that worked... Don't know the number of it right now,
but I guess any one-piece pajama pattern would work, you'd just have
to modify it.

Have never gotten anything besides samples from them myself, but I've
heard from various people that they're ok :)

They have some nice products. The cat print furs are kind of low pile 
though.

Message-ID: <bda.ff905ce.3310afa8@aol.com>

FA: United!
www.faunited.org 

Register  online for FA: United! Attending membership is only $30!  The furry 
 convention is taking place from August 10-12, 2007 at the Ramada Inn Newark  
International Airport hotel, A Wyndham Worldwide Hotel, in Newark, New 
Jersey!  

In This Issue:

1. In Which a Charity is Revealed
2. If Our  Rap's Soup, Our Beats is Stock
3. Like Mardi Gras, Only Less Mardi (And More  Gras)
4. Our Mailing List Makes You Sexy and  Attractive[*]

-----=====-----

1. In Which a Charity is  Revealed

One of our goals at FA United is to keep in touch with our local  community, 
and in that spirit we set out to find a local animal-based charity to  sponsor 
at our event. We wanted a charity where donations would have an effect  right 
here in our back yard, and where the money could benefit the animals  
directly without getting caught up in administrative overhead.

We are  pleased to announce the Lakota Wolf Preserve as our charity for FA 
United 2007.  Located near the Delaware Water Gap in Columbia, NJ, the Lakota 
Wolf Preserve is  home to 24 wolves, as well as two foxes and three bobcats. The 
money you donate  will go to the care and feeding of the animals, as well as 
maintaining their  habitat.

How can you help support this charity? The easiest (and most  fun!) way is to 
participate in our Charity Raffle, either by donating items for  others to 
bid on, or by bidding on items yourself. Raffle tickets will be $1  each, or 6 
for $5, and 100% of the proceeds from the raffle will be donated to  Lakota 
Wolf. (If you'd like to donate any items for the raffle, send an email to  
faunited at faunited.org to let us know what you've got.)

Lakota will also  have merchandise for sale in our Dealer Room, including the 
option to sponsor a  wolf. A $25 donation gets you an invitation to their 
observation area, a photo  magnet of your wolf, and their quarterly newsletter. 
For $45 you'll get a second  visit and a Sponsors-only t-shirt. And for $100, 
you get a third visit and a  framed 5x7 print of your lucky lupine.

-----=====-----

2. If Our  Rap's Soup, Our Beats is Stock

What's the only thing better than having a  DJ rock the house all night long? 
How about having *four* of them, plus some  live bands? That's what we 
thought.

Friday night's party bring us three  incredible international furry DJs. How 
incredible, you ask? So incredible that  our lawyers have advised us not to re
lease their names, for fear of being mobbed  by crazed fanboys who just can't 
wait for August before they start partying!  (Ok, that's a lie. They're not 
really lawyers, they're the night crew at IHOP.  But one of them says his 
uncle's a lawyer.)

On Saturday, only one word  can describe what we have in store, and that word 
is "live entertainment." (Yes,  that's one word. Trust us.) We've got a pair 
of furry bands opening up, followed  by one of Brooklyn's best acts, The Gay 
Blades, who we are told are not actually  gay, and do not actually slay 
vampires, though we have been asked to keep them  away from garlic. To top everything 
off, we'll be bringing in another DJ to keep  the party going well into the 
night.

And hey, let's admit it -- what's a  furcon party without some, er... 'adult 
beverages,' right? Well you'll be happy  to find a cash bar open through the 
whole show each night, serving up name-brand  liquors and a decent selection of 
beers. Of course, you'll need to prove you're  over 21 to the bartender, so 
make sure you bring your  ID.

-----=====-----

3. Like Mardi Gras, Only Less Mardi (And More  Gras)

That's right, a furcon just isn't a furcon without a Masquerade!  For the 
uninitiated, it's a bit like a high school talent show, only less school  (and 
maybe a little more high). Who wouldn't want to be a part of  that?

Not you, that's who... wouldn't... not want to... wait, let's try  that again.

Who wouldn't want to be a part of that? Only the lame, the  square, and the 
fundamentally un-hip, that's who. Surely you aren't any of  that...right?

So, show us what you've got! Send us your idea for a talent  you'd like to 
show off or a skit you'd like to perform, and we might just give  you your 15 
minutes of fame. Write to us at faunited at faunited.org and tell us  all about it. 
Then when you're good and famous you can go rub it in your high  school 
guidance counsellor's face for suggesting 'animal husbandry' as your  ideal career 
field.

What's that? Animal husbandry *is* your...you know  what? Just don't use that 
in your masquerade act, and you'll be fine. We  promise.

Hello all!

I'm making my first suit and I'm flying blind (well almost -made a  
really crappy half suit about 13 years ago).
I've made the head out of those 1" foam sheets and carved the shape  
out.  I'm wondering the best way to go about attaching the fur fabric  
to it to get the proper curves on the muzzle and cheeks -sew? glue?   
is there perhaps a website with a step by step or does anyone have a  
link to a in depth detailed 'how-to' discussion?

Please help!  it's coming along very well so far but I want to make  
sure I do it correctly all the way through so it ends up fantastic - 
thanks!

Here's what I invented on my own:

- After the head shape is finished, I then put down a thin layer of
batting over the plastic mesh and foam rubber (actually, I use floor
heat register filter pads) which provides that soft give of real flesh
just before the firmer foam underneath (and it covers any plastic mesh
and any lumps in the foam).  I attach that to the foam rubber using
Super 77 and let it dry completely for a few days.

- Then, I start attaching the fur to that batting layer, again using
Super 77.  I take care to (a) fit the fur pieces in place first, (b)
spray only the batting, never the fur, and (c) ventilate, ventilate,
ventilate.  If I get the glue too thick on the batting, I let it dry
first before I come back and try again.  Otherwise, pressing the fur
down to the thick glue can cause the glue to come up through the fur
fabric and glue the fur together.

Thanks, you guys, fur all your help -I definitely feel better about  
proceeding -was just starting to feel like 'what have I got myself  
into here' lol!

last question - well fur now lol

where to find fur with a really really long pile -like 3 -4 inches?

I actually bought a huge piece ten years ago from Sage's fabrics when  
i lived in massachusetts before I got into fursuiting (I used it as a  
dern blanket) so I know it exists as someone out there makes it. (i'd  
be using it now but I actually threw it out a few years back since it  
got funky in my basement -drat)
I've got some great samples from distinctivefabric.com and I'll  
probably be making an order with them for various colors -but the  
white, 3 inch pile eludes me.
If anyone has an idea -please let me know -thanks!

That's Monterey Mills, and the link will take you right to their "white fox" 
fur. That's a 3 inch pile, and it's fabulous stuff, I've got a bunch right 
now I'm working with.

Niiku........would you happen to have any of the 3" pile in a tan - beige? 
If so, would you be willing to sell some of it. I have been searching high 
and low for shag this long, but to no avail so far. I notice that monterey 
only sells in rolls....I only need about 3 - 4 feet.

Niiku,

Saweet!  That's gotta be the same stuff I bought years ago - I  
remember it was on a roll.  Gadzooks though I only need 5 yards -I'm  
going to email them about retailers they sell to.  Would you happen  
to have five yards you need to get rid of? Let me know ;)
Thanks!

That's Monterey Mills, and the link will take you right to their  
"white fox" fur. That's a 3 inch pile, and it's fabulous stuff, I've  
got a bunch right now I'm working with.

You may want to check with Hancock Fabrics. They can order what you want 
if you give them enough information. I should know, as I used to work at a 
Hancock Fabrics awhile ago.

But beware that some other fabric places can be hit or miss. Another 
person mentioned doing the 'grand tour' of most of the fabric stores in 
your city. Strangely enough, though it doesn't often happen, you may find 
some at thrifts/resales.

Funnily enough, I remarked to someone that complained that the lab at 
their workplace is cold enough to wear winter jackets in that I could make 
them a furry jumpsuit. What did they say? "Make one!" Make one I will... 
Attached paws, etc... I wonder what the coworkers will say.

Message-ID: <20070227135449.F39867@j3.timduru.org>


Yeah, It's finally that time,
one year already that the show has been running :o)

The 1st anniversary show will be a best-of taken from the previous shows,
mixed with some new videos, and mix of mixes ;)
If everything goes well I'll also premiere my new FC2007 mix,
or at least its beta version if I can't finish in time ;)


And for those who don't know about it , shame on you ;)
You've missed one year of show already.
http://fursuittv.timduru.org

So for those who've never heard of it:
FursuitTV is a monthly show streamed online, showing a mix of various
fursuit / costume videos from many different sources.
Made by a fan for fursuiters and fans, the show also uses an irc
channel for viewers to join and talk about what they see and exchange
experiences and ideas, and it usually brings quite a few nice talks amongs
fans :)

So even if the show is available for download shortly after the airing,
don't be lazy and join the fun in the IRC channel, it's one of the main
goal of the show to bring fursuiters and fans together for a friendly talk
about their favorite subjects that the show will bring in their mind. :)


So for those interested, tune in next saturday, and spread the word ! :)
The more to watch and join on IRC the more fun :)
See the webpage for all the details :)

Until then if you have questions or remarks
don't hesitate to ask me,
and feel free to connect to the
test loop running, so that you have
your player ready for saturday :)

Check out CR's Crafts - www.crscrafts.com - they retail Monterey Mills faux furs and have good prices and good service.   You can order a full set of sample cards for about $20 I think.

what time are you gonna air the fursuitTV so I can join and watch it since I saw some of it the last time.

tim1 at timduru.org wrote:  
Yeah, It's finally that time,
one year already that the show has been running :o)

The 1st anniversary show will be a best-of taken from the previous shows,
mixed with some new videos, and mix of mixes ;)
If everything goes well I'll also premiere my new FC2007 mix,
or at least its beta version if I can't finish in time ;)


And for those who don't know about it , shame on you ;)
You've missed one year of show already.
http://fursuittv.timduru.org

So for those who've never heard of it:
FursuitTV is a monthly show streamed online, showing a mix of various
fursuit / costume videos from many different sources.
Made by a fan for fursuiters and fans, the show also uses an irc
channel for viewers to join and talk about what they see and exchange
experiences and ideas, and it usually brings quite a few nice talks amongs
fans :)

So even if the show is available for download shortly after the airing,
don't be lazy and join the fun in the IRC channel, it's one of the main
goal of the show to bring fursuiters and fans together for a friendly talk
about their favorite subjects that the show will bring in their mind. :)


So for those interested, tune in next saturday, and spread the word ! :)
The more to watch and join on IRC the more fun :)
See the webpage for all the details :)

Until then if you have questions or remarks
don't hesitate to ask me,
and feel free to connect to the
test loop running, so that you have
your player ready for saturday :)

The airing time is 10pm GMT,
so it would depends where you are located :)

In France it's 11pm
in US-East coast it is 5pm

The show will replay after the first airing.
But for the IRC talks, it's mostly busy during the first broadcast. :)

("Fursuit TV").

Hi all.

Does anyone know of a Fursuit designer who would be able to make some foot paws that look like Army Boots? Most suits, I know, have 'naked' feet, but my character wears big, chunky shoes. I don't really want to change the way he looks, so can anyone point me to someone, or somewhere, that could help me out?

Thanks,

Hedgie

Starts at 10pm CET, so:

Central European Time: UTC+1
Mountain Time Zone: UTC-7

So that would be 2pm, unless my high school math is failing again :)

Hello!

I'm just wondering if there are any Fursuit makers or Fursuiters on  
the list from North Carolina.  I was making my suit with FWA in mind  
but I keep forgetting that there could be bowling and whatnot and the  
possibility of meeting new local friends.  Please let me know!

Thanks!

I personally use the fake leather, I have pretty good traction.  The
following link has pics of the construction of the feet for my suit.

http://www.foxwolfart.furtopia.org/Foxwolf%20comes%20to%20life/Paws%20construction/

The first three pictures are the most relevant.

Hope this helps. =^_^=

Hmm, never gotten that, I use gmail.  Must be something with your email
server.

That's my rough guess anyway.

We use a rubber tread it is only available to companies, we use to use rubber floor matting. to find a good supplier for feet bottoms is always a change. We use a company called Rubex you may want to see if they sell by the piece. It is knobby one side 1/inch sheet rubber.

I just got the same thing from my last post, perhaps the list has 
been hijacked somehow?

Ordering stuff is expensive some times. I use a simple but very effective 
method of a condensed foam that can be bought at any craft store Its called Craft 
Foam and comes in sheets and in almost any color and can with stand allot of 
abuse. Its pliable, shapable and can be hot glued to anything because the glue 
will cause part of it to melt and bond to the item being glued.

Hello all!

I wasn't sure for a while there whether this was relevant to the list  
but after some contemplation I think it may be something to post.
I was going by the name "Spark" as it is my character name on  
FurryMuck but I was made aware that there is another established  
Fursuit maker with that name so I apologize to you, Spark, and to the  
list for any confusion I may have caused.  Since I am really only  
going to have one suit for quite some time I thought I might go by my  
new fursuit character's name, "Scape".
Sorry fur the trouble and thanks for all of your help and patience  
with a newbie!

- Scape

;)

Well,
  I went down to the local leather shop that I used to frequent,and he made 
sandals. He had sheets of thick,rubber he used for the soles after cut to 
shape. I bought some,but it wasnt cheap!! I'm thinking about thirty dollars 
for just enough to do two feet. Also,I know Vibram(the shoe solw maker)has 
sheets of a compressed foam rubber,but I still havent been able to come 
across it,although I ve seen many a paw made from it. Hope this helps,even 
alittle!!

Thanks for all the cool ideas.  I've also discovered 3.00 black  
rubberized mousepads at walmart and wondered if anyones tried that?   
looks like it could last a good long while ;)

speaking of mouse pads for tread, reminds me why i still use the one that
came with my Macintosh LC II ( circa 1993 ) it's in fabulous condition still
and i love the black rubbered matting on the bottom, it seems that all
"Modern" mousepads from dell,gateway,etal just decompose after a month of
use and this one is well  FROM 1993 xD  and still kicking :3

so yea try it out <3

    Anybody know what happened to Primal Visions?  Are they still doing fursuit commissions?  Their website is down and the e-mail is bouncing back on me.

    On a separate note, I am looking for white fur in two-inch, but preferrabley three-inch pile that is also DENSE.  Some of this fur will be shaved down for around a muzzle, so it cannot be sparce.

of what you're looking for. I have some of the white you speak of.....great 
for airbrushing. Also, does it have to be true white...or can it be off a 
little? I had some off white in 3" that was so dense I could hardly comb it. 
Unfortunately, it was an end of the roll....not much there.

I think what you're looking for is the Monterey Mills white fox fur. :3 I've 
got a bunch of that and it's really thick, real nice, and shaves down 
nicely, and it's also 3 3/8 inch pile. Just do a google search for "monterey 
mills" and you'll get their website.

Also, I have no clue what happened to Primal Visions, I tried looking at 
their site earlier today and it didnt work. :(

Very nice, as usual.  I had to chuckle at one photo however as the tiger 
appeared to be cross eyed.

Great work.

I've already made a few masks, including a Golden Asian Cat and a timber wolf, but every time I do create them they are tight and and are not sturdy around the head (the muzzles are good, but the actual 'circle' where my head fits in is not self-supported at all. It was constructed from mesh (one bad point, I know, but its good for keeping the head small and better-proportioned to the rest of the fursuits), as well as upholstery foam, hot glue, and as you can tell, lots and lots of fur, clay, and brush hairs.
  If anyone has suggestions for better materials or better techniques other than what I've been using, please tell mer (keep in mind, though; I'm only 16 and have no access to many of the things you professional fursuiters out there use, including metal mesh, heat guns, and a model other than myself or a head-shaped object laying around the house).
   
  Here are the furheads:
  The timber wolf (has no eyes since I was using it for Halloween-the Norse mythological wolf Fenrir or Fenris- and late at night, and needed as much visual freedom as possible-not many picts, but maybe enough to give someone of an idea of what I've been trying to work on, and sorry that there are no front views...-^_^-):

Dangit... could someone make it available (hopefully in a file that can be saved

Cool little segment!  Most everything covered there has been covered
on the list and elsewhere, but it's still cool to see a video of
creation methods in action by a larger-scale company.

By the way, for those who missed it, it focuses on the creation of
this guy, sans bib:

http://preview.tinyurl.com/2ptwww

The feature was restricted to a few minutes, so it focused more on
head & foot creation.  Head was carved from several sheets of soft
foam, and foot seemed to be carved from a single block of it.  (Toe
claws were later attached via sewing.)  It also made light mention of
pattern making and sewing of the body and hands.

The clip also features fleece as a fabric of choice. (Which is good
stuff.  Having worked with it, its strechiness allows it to show foam
details and grooves pretty well.)

[ Only thing is, did they really add any way for the costume head to
attach to the performer's head? ]

I always try to make the part where my nead fits in the mask an 
inch or so larger, its been my experience that when you go and 
attach the muzle, ears, cheek pieces, ect, that the mask seems to 
flatten out a bit in those places and it makes the mask seem 
smaller inside..

take a look at my mask making faq, might give ya an idea or two..

I think fursuit.timduru.org has the video captured and up already,  
actually. If not I'm not sure where but I have already seen it.
Check around. It is on the net somewhere. ;)

Hi there! 

Some of you may be aware that  there is a New Jersey furry convention August 
10th - 12th of this year!   
FA:United!  FA = Fur Affinity, the art website,  http://www.furaffinity.net
Even though the site is mostly focused on art,  they do have photography as 
well! And a lot of fursuit photos!  

For  the convention, we are putting panels together and we would really like 
some  fursuiters to come and "share their craft" so to speak :) Panels on  
construction, performance, tips and anything else!  Anyone on this list  planning 
to go? If so, would you be interested hosting a Fursuit panel?  

For more information, or if you would like to host a panel, please email  
panels at faunited.org or get in touch with Foxwell or JD Puppy @  
fursuit at faunited.org !

Seeing how Alkora and I make fursuits in our spare time and also have had
quite a lot of involvement in FA, I definitely wouldn't mind.  Originally I
wasn't thinking I'd be able to make FA: United, though it looks like I might
be recruited to be Alkora's escort, or something to that affect.   Either
way, Alkora's a pretty accomplished fursuit maker, and you know for sure
he'll be going.  I'll be sure to ask him about it when I see him later
today.  I'm sure he'd do a great job ^^

awh *blush* I love all of you! :)  

While I'm writing on this list, I don't think I've made it known, on this  
list, that we have fursuit workshops in NJ! :) to find out more, go to 
_http://communities.livejournal.com/newjerseyfurs/profile_ 
(http://communities.livejournal.com/newjerseyfurs/profile) 
Right now we only have a couple of regulars.. but looking for more :) as  
it's hard to find a workshop that goes on during the weekend these days.. I know  
there is one in MD that recently started up, but it's on mondays :( and I 
can't  make that..

Hey every one, I'm doing some touch ups on one of my suits and I was 
wondering if anyone knew if it is even possible to find really dense black fur that's 
well 9 inches long. I have hunted everywhere and I'm about to just special 
order some but I thought I should at least ask before spending a lot of money. 
Thanks

Two ways come to mind. I'm sure you know of the first which is to fork 
over a palletload to National Fiber Technologies.

The second may sound weird. You can use wigs. Yes, wigs.

It's been done before on a Wookiee suit. There was a German page that 
showed how it was done. It came out pretty nicely. Anyone know the URL to 
that page?

I used hair from Sally Beauty Supply for a horsetail one time. For the 
headpiece for the mane, I cut up a wig. Others have used wigs for long 
fur/hair on the head and other places as needed.

Here's one page that shows how they did it;

http://www.stripedsmiles.com/

The fursuit FAQ/wiki and a few other searches around the net will locate 
more pages that can help. The good thing about wigs is that if you do it 
right, you can easily replace the area that's wearing out.

Who is your costuming/FX GOH?
If you have someone to draw the crowds, you will probably get more suiters to go.

Hey guys, I'm scouring the internet right now looking for a good long-pile 
ROYAL blue fur. Like crayola royal blue. XD Problem is, I keep finding FUN 
FUR which is crap, as we all know. I'd like to find something of good 
quality that's still the right color. Anyone have any ideas?

Dunno if this is the right color you want, but I KNOW for a fact that 
this stuff is probably some of the best quality fur I have ever seen...
Hope this helps ^^

That stuff's too light. The customer I'm making this for needs it to be a 
deep royal blue, because the rest of her fur is baby blue, so it really 
needs to stand out.

Hello,

I am getting ready to fur the head and wondered about experienced  
opinions on which glue to use.  I have hot glue and super77 -glued  
some experimental scraps of fur to foam last night and both seem good  
but I though I'd better ask your opinions.  Been to the how-to  
sections and it seems that people use both but I wondered what the  
pros and cons are of each.
Thanks!

I think hot glue is what is most commonly used, it's what I used for both of my fursuit heads. It's easy to work with and cheap!

The only down side I have had with hot glue is removing it once it's dry .. it a real pain - the easiest way I've found to remove fur from hot glued items is to re-heat the hot glue using the hot glue gun without any glue.

I've also hand-sewn some parts of the fur to the head - that would probably be the prefered method - but it's extremely time consuming and you would been some  basic sewing skills.

I've also seen people velco fur to heads - with the added benefit of removing the fur from a fursuit skull to wash it.

Good Luck!

The flexibility is a good point! I know I had a few folks tug on my ears,so 
im glad the glue could bend. I used hot glue and it has held up just great!! 
Just one thing. Get the position right first,like a dry fit,cause if the 
glue dries,you ll have a,not so great time getting it off.....If you can!!!

CRs crafts cubby furs are a little hit and miss, some of them are quite good 
quality, so you can check those out.  If you have a big budget though, you 
may want to look into Premiuim Furs Tissavel fabric.  Their bear furs are 
quite awesome, super dense and very soft.  But they're $$$  You'll probably 
want to order samples before actualy buying either, I'd say.  Unfortunately 
neither of them do free swatches, you'll have to pay.

For hot glue, I have found that the Stanly Dual Melt glue gun works well on the "low" setting.  The "high" setting is a bit too warm, especially with upholstry foam.

A few minutes under a hair dryer will give you a second chance with any hot glue and foam mistakes. You'll never get all the hot glure off, but you can scrape off a good 90% of it with the help of a hair dryer and detatch and foam pieces incorrectly attached.

Thanks fur all the great advice on the head furring - i will be doing  
that soon =)

Question on arms/ hands now...
I can't quite tell from photos how the hands attach, whether they are  
sewn right to the end of the sleeve or if they are separate.  the  
ones that appear separate look like they come up to the forearm/  
elbow -if so is it elastic maybe?  How do you keep the fabric from  
sliding down?  My old suit from way back in the day was horrible and  
the sleeves never stayed in place.  Just wondered opinions -thanks!

Mine are detactable hand paws.  The paw part goes inside the sleeve,
the sleeve is such a tight fit that the paw stays in with little
problem. you could also use a velco system if you wanted to.

ya know their measurments don't make any sence, .25 meter does = about 10 
inches, Dia's right, so why do they say the peice measures what it 
does...*confused*  590" surface area for that vs 1296" for a sq yard or 
aboit .45  of a yard.

One thing though the prices are in something other then USD, it's only $11 
USD, so about $44 a yard based on  a 1/4?  pricey but not totaly out of the 
ball park for quality fur i guess.

based on the actual surface area they claim  that's like $25 a yard. If my 
math is correct, which si pretty average

It definatly needs clarification

A yard of fabric is NOT a square yard of area.  A standard fabric yard is 
one yard long, and SIXTY INCHES wide, so it's just a little short of being 
TWO square  yards of area.

Just so you know.

Subject: FL: Fursuit Bowling in CT
Message-ID: <BAY121-F12508C50C802DC6F17B3F1D06C0@phx.gbl>

I am planning to host a fursuit bowling event sometime in May or early June 
somewhere in CT. An exact date and location has yet to be determined.


I would like to get an idea of the following before deciding on a place and 
date:

Who is interested in attending?
Are there conflicting furry gatherings happening in May/June?
Duckpin or Ten Pin? Duckpin has small balls/pins. Ten Pin is standard 
bowling fare.

If your interested please send a private email to wallyfox98 at hotmail.com


Last year we bowled at Johnson's Duckpin Lanes in Hamden, CT. We left a good 
impression on the owners and we are welcome back. Changing space was tight 
as we were limited to the bathrooms and a small storage area.

I am going to look at some other facilities in the area. There are only a 
handful of suitable duckpin alleys in the state. If the group is very large 
we may have to do ten pin.

Hi guys, you DO have to be careful anyhow. Before you buy, check the width
of the roll they will be cutting.

I have seen widths of:
45"
48"
58"
60"

***MOST*** rolls I have seen are standard 60", though I have seen 'short
rolls' of 45"

Thanks for your clarification of yardage total, SPark.

I have some muslin that's 3 yards (108 inches) wide, foam is often sold 24 inches wide. though 60in. seems to be the most common amount, don't forget to ask.

Pay attention to the details, some things are sold square (1 yard X 1 yard X price) and some are sold LINEAR yardage (1 yard X roll width X price).

Sometimes fabric is actuallt 60 inches but it's kept on a short roll folded double.

The point is, before you buy makes sure and if you're not sure, ask.

Hi,

I actually use Fabric Tac by Beacon brand.

Fabric Tac is flexible and washable! =) And you can get it at pretty  
much any craft or fabric store.  It's around $5 for 4oz. and $10 for  
8oz., so it can be pretty expensive if you're wasteful.  It's EXACTLY  
like hot glue without the hot, so no worrying about burns or when the  
glue leaks out of the tip.. eeew.  It's just a li'l more convenient  
than hot glue 'cause you just squeeze it right out of the bottle.

The downsides are the same as hot glue, its a li'l messy if you don't  
handle it with care; once it dries, it's there for good; if you  
squeeze too much on, it will dry hard and you might (rarely to never,  
if you're good with it) be able to feel the hardness through the fur  
depending on the thickness of your fur and softness of your foam (or  
whatever you're gluing your fur to).

I've made two heads using this glue and I've loved the results. Hope  
that could help.

started dabbling  in remix production many years ago, he knew where he would 
come to settle.   Since 0J has started, he's gone from producing tracks to 
throwing himself center  stage, DJing for many
events since early '05. Illuminated by the glow of his  monitor, he will rock 
the dance floor with his bass, filters, and grooves. Trust  me, it's catchy, 
you'll like it.

Thanks to everyone fur all the tips =)  I thought I would be gluing  
last weekend but some fur that I drove hours to pick up turned out to  
be the wrong color.  What's really cool is though I think it's going  
to be even better lol.  I just have a couple more swatches to wait on  
and then may be ordering one more time.  I'll post a link after a bit.
At least I've got feet done finally yay!

Thanks!

That's right. In Vegas terms 7 come 11 is a natural win in Craps! That's what this year's MFM is going to be...a WINNER! Elvis did Viva Las Vegas, so why can't we!

 

Skunky Scuttlebutt

Labor Day Weekend 2007

Guest of Honor: Writer -  Jim Lane 

With Special Guest in Concert: Sub-level 03

There are ONLY 136 Days Remaining before Tyger Opens MFM 11 with these words  "Welcome Home".    That's right, we are quickly approaching the start of Mephit FurMeet 2007, the place so many of us now call home.   Make your plans now to attend one of the BEST gatherings in the furry community. 

 

--=={ New and improved website!! }==--

 

Through the hard work of Rama and Red Card we have a newly designed MFM website this year with lots of new features. Check out everything that's going on over there!

http://www.mephitfurmeet.org 

 

--=={ Hotel Reservation Info, Rooms Going Fast! }==--

 

We will once again be in the Holiday Inn Select Memphis Airport, located at 2240 Democrat Road, Memphis TN 38132-1807. The special Mephit Fur Meet rate is $99 per night for 1-4 people in the room. Rooms are available with one king size bed or 2 double beds and your choice of either smoking or nonsmoking. The layout of the hotel is perfect for MFM with the main level being on the 3rd floor of the hotel allowing everyone to be either on the main level or not more than 2 floors up or down. So it makes getting to panels, socializing in the Garden Court (a huge atrium area of the hotel) or fursuiting a breeze. You can book your room online at:

http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/sl/1/en/cwshome/DPRD-6X4LWC/MEMDR/website/

or

Call 800-653-6524 or email mfmdirector at hotmail.com to make your reservation!

Don't wait till it's too late! Suites are already SOLD OUT!!

 

The hotel promises that they have a lot of the issues encountered worked out for this year. (remember we had a total staff change just a few weeks before the con!)

 

--=={ Celebrating Life }==-- 

 

Each and every one of us has a lot to be thankful for in our lives. We have friends, mentors, partners, spouses, animal companions that we see every day or that have gone on to better places. This year at MFM we will, though our Spirituality Track have something special to remember those that are important to us. While not something that everyone has to participate in, this will give those that want to, a chance to remember the happy times. A chance to say thank you for those special influences in our lives. We are adding to our special memory book again this year to remember those that have impacted our lives

 

--=={ Registration }==-- 

We know it's all fun and games, but hey, we have to pay our bills too! That's where registration comes in. We strive to keep our prices low and have not had a price increase in over 6 years. We know you work hard to earn your money, so we try to give you the most bang for your con-going buck. Not only do we have a regular membership, but if you have some more money to spend and want to help out the convention, sign up for one of our higher levels. We'll even give you some nice thank you gifts for giving us your extra dough.

Preregistration is currently open until August 1st, 2007. By buying a registration now, not only do you save some money, but it allows us to make sure you get your swag at the door. However, just signing up for preregistration doesn't get you in the door. Any unpaid registration after August 1st will be dropped and you will be forced to sign up again at the door.

Don't worry if you can't register before the deadline, we'll still let you come and register at the door! 

Registration will be open Thursday evening, all day Friday, Saturday morning and early afternoon and Sunday morning.

Rates for the convention are as follows:

SUPPORTING:
Include a tshirt and program mailed to you. Does NOT include a membership for you to attend the convention but does allow you to pay a reduced price of $20 at the door for a total admission of $35.

--=={ Room and Rideshare Board! }==--

 

Need a Ride to MFM?  Need a place to sleep when you get there?  On our web page http://www.mephitfurmeet.org  you can post a message on the room and ride share lists and find all you need

 

--=={ Tiger Haven Auction }==-- 

 

We are still looking for donations for this year's Tiger Haven Charity Auction. This can be art, commissions, clean plush, anything Furry related. Once again we will have representatives from Tiger Haven http://www.tigerhaven.org to talk with about their awesome work and also see what goodies they and their staff have made for their table. MFM continues to be Tiger Haven's largest single group contributor. To make a donation or more info email Hikaru at hikaru at ic-stories.com 

 

--=={ Programming }==-- 

 

Want to share your knowledge? If you would like to take on the task of heading up a panel, email the name and a brief description of your panel to our programming director, Maui.  Contact Information can be found at our website.

 

--=={ LAN Gaming Information }==-- 

 

Once again this year, MFM will be featuring LAN gaming. Bring your machine and participate in a free-for-all-furry-fragfest! The LAN will have (at least) limited Megabit support this year. We'll also have some new games.  Expect to see a lot of the newest games!  Requests are welcome. We are also planning a couple exhibition matches you won't want to miss.  More details on these in the near future.

 

--=={ Video Room }==-- 

 

Your loyal Furs from the Video Room are working on putting together a surprise.

We'll be posting a 'poll' on the homepage where YOU can look over the videos currently available for the Video Room and vote on the ones you want most to have shown at MFM this year.  Or, if you have a video that you don't see posted, you can offer to bring it with you. Hopefully this will allow us to post the video schedule WITH the program rather then do it on a day-by-day basis as in the past. Keep your eyes peeled for the official announcement then let us know your desires.

 

--=={ T-Shirt Contest }==-- 

 

1) What's up for grabs?

There are three chances for your artwork to be selected for MFM's T-Shirts.

**Attendees Choice - The winner of the Attendees Choice will have their artwork featured on the front of the MFM T-Shirts.   This is chosen by you, the attendees (natch). 
**Director's Choice - The winner of the Director's Choice will be featured on the back of the MFM T-Shirt 
**Staff Choice - This will be chosen by the staff and be featured on their staff shirts
Each winner will receive a free attending membership.

 

***Complete details and rules on the website http://www.mephitfurmeet.org ***

 

--=={ MFM Masquerade }==-- 

 

As always, no MFM would be complete without the Masquerade! This year we have a special challenge to our performers to come up with a "Vegas theme" act. Let's see just how creative and warped their minds are.



--=={ Dance/Karaoke Information }==-- 

 

This year's dance will be a prom theme.   Bring a date and dance the night away.   We will also be doing Furry karaoke again this year. We also have 2 special dances planned as well!

 

--=={ Share Your Interests With Others }==-- 

 

MFM recognizes the diversity in interests among its attendees.   In an effort to provide folks with special interests with a place to meet and greet, MFM will allow groups to make use of its unused space, free of cost, to its attendees.

Hi Folks

I'm looking at an interesting product called by a number of name. Shapelock
is the US, and Polymorph is the UK

Its a nylon style plastic that becomes very pliable at atroun 62 degrees C,
and when cooled  can be cut,m ground, drilled etc.

If heated up even more  it become very liquid and can be used as a glue...
Or to paint on foam to give it a hard shell outer.

Price is VERY reasonable too.

Just something for folk to look at as it is an excellent replacement for
fibreglass

Hi folks,

Finished my panther mascot last week after spending the last 9 weekends on 
him, will put pics up next week!!!!

Head was made with 20mm PE45. Took a pattern of a small horse riding helmet 
and made the harness to that pattern using EVA30 an braced it to the head 
shell using 40mm PE 45.

Just that took me a day and a bit, remember this stuff is pretty ridgid 
getting the angles right was job in itself.

I took a pattern of one side of the head and hand sewed each section and 
pulled it over like a sock. when the fur was on, I then cut the ear holes 
out of the fur, likewise with the eyes.

I left pins around the lines of where I marked the positions so I couild 
feel where i Was.

I also furred the ears FIRST before I attatched them to the main shell. Is 
this wise???

worked out well, but still not happy.

Can someone please share how to go about furring heads in detail.

Might souns silly but to you pro's out there,  is there a huge difference 
between Small heads and big mascot heads in construction???

The reason I say this is I've pulled my hair out trying to come up with a 
decent head harness system for large heads and HOW to mount them inside with 
success!!!




Dont follow me, I'm lost too :)

Luke from South Austraila.

  This is a mask I just finished for a Hindu temple and will be used for 
ritual story telling.


  Here is more information on the Hindu god or aspect of the god I created.

  http://www.saigan.com/heritage/gods/narasmha.htm

  He is supposed to enraged and thus he is in an angry snarling pose. from 
what I understand
  the temple will be marking him on the forehead with some paint/dye to 
signify the deity. And he will be wearing a gold crown of some kind. I hope 
to get video of the event he will be used in this weekend.

  Here he is.

Very impressive.  How did you make the wrinkles on the nose and 
forehead?  From what I've seen, putting that kind of detail into the 
structure under the fur just gets hidden by the fur...  Is the fur cut 
at varying lengths to get the wrinkles?

-Uck!

That is really neat, Lionel! I recently spoke to a friend's mother who is a minister, and she's considering having me make a mask for her to use in storytelling for the children. That lion turned out really awesome though, I'm sure it'll be cherished by the people who commissioned it.~Niiku> From: solion at comcast.net> To: fursuit-list at lists.fursuit.org> Date: Tue, 24 Apr 2007 21:20:41 -0400> Subject: FL: New lion> >   This is a mask I just finished for a Hindu temple and will be used for > ritual story telling.> > >   Here is more information on the Hindu god or aspect of the god I created.> >   http://www.saigan.com/heritage/gods/narasmha.htm> >   He is supposed to enraged and thus he is in an angry snarling pose. from > what I understand>   the temple will be marking him on the forehead with some paint/dye to > signify the deity.

It is a combination of techniques that I tried for the first time. both a 
bunching of the fur and laying down lines of glue. then shaving the fur from 
each of the creases to get the effect. it was .... touchy to say the least 
every second I swear I was gonna mess it up. the nose and the eyes took 
hours and lots of handcramping to hol it in place as the hot glue cooled.

only accommodate 2-3 furs.

Hi everyone-

I know, long time no post. Between traveling all over for my job and 
keeping my vixen happy - I'm surprised I have any time at all to think 
about fursuiting. Yet I do, happily! So I am looking for some Monterey 
Mills Cubby Bear Red Fox fur, including some scraps and a couple of 
yards full (60") width. If anyone has any, I would really appreciate an 
email with the size of pieces and any reimbursement you would like...

Thanks!

- Camstone Fox (camstone =dot= fox =at= gmail =dot= com)

P.S. (And I do appreciate the list admins and users for keeping the list 
both professional and courteous! =)

Hi!  I've been performing Roxikat for over a decade and I've finally 
decided that I want to comission an artist for a real fursuit.
(I'm growing tired of Roxi, but I want to finish the character before I 
seek to get a male suit for myself finally.)

In the past, I've worn a spandex unitard because I was hoping for the 
toony smooth look.
I'm discovering that as I get older, spandex is looking spooky on me 
without proper padding.

I brainstormed the look, and I'm hoping to get an estimate. 
http://picasaweb.google.com/roxikat/FursuitIdeas/photo#5062031613506939042

Barring that, is anyone interested in sharing some thoughts and ideas 
with me on how I can make this silly comedy character a reality?

Thanks for your time!

HI there Roxi!
Nice pic of a new Roxi.  I would suggest going to LiveJournal, and post
this on LJ FursuitAuctions.  (no, not only for Auctions but most fursuit
makers read this community, and it helps getting Quotes!)

Also, if you go to the main page:
http://community.livejournal.com/fursuitauctions/profile  There is a list
I gathered of all the fursuit makers I know of if you wanted to go to
their website and find a "look" you think will fit.

I Called Dow about this product, and they have informed me it has 
been discontinued as of Sept 2006. 

Caprolactone also apparently causes severe eye irritation and may 
cause corneal damage if the product comes in contact. I would be 
interested to hear of anyone using this for molding fursuit heads, 
if indeed there were any irritation effects from the *cured* plastic.

-Maxx Coyote

I'm looking at an interesting product called by a number of name. 
Shapelock
is the US, and Polymorph is the UK

Its a nylon style plastic that becomes very pliable at atroun 62 
degrees C,
and when cooled  can be cut,m ground, drilled etc.

If heated up even more  it become very liquid and can be used as a 
glue...
Or to paint on foam to give it a hard shell outer.

Price is VERY reasonable too.

Just something for folk to look at as it is an excellent replacement 
for
fibreglass

yards and the other is 5.375 but i can't remember which is which  
lol.  I'll measure the roll width too. i believe the pile is 1" but  
it may be just a hair longer *pun* lol

How much would you sell the fur for? Depending on price and of course
the color, I'd buy some.

i'll have to get back to you all tonight or tomorrow about it.  Sorry  
about not knowing the specs -i guess i just wondered if anyone would  
even be interested -lol
It really is a sweet color -i've never seen a blue like it before - 
almost wish i could keep it but i changed the color scheme of my suit  
plus my house is so small and i think it would be years before i'd  
end up using it -better to go to a good home where it will turn into  
something really cool ;)

I totally wasn't expecting the response I got for the blue fur lol!   
Since I'm new to this, it did not occur to me to take photos, look  
into auctioning or how I would go about shipping it.  I won't be able  
to sell it right away anyways and with the prospect last night of  
wrapping up a bunch of projects before summer there may be a chance I  
might still use it.  If and when I find it definitely needs a home, I  
will probably try for an auction but i will certainly let you know  
before it goes up for sale.
Thanks!

making it moveable -I just have no idea where to start the process.   
I've got a foam face (still haven't furred it yet)

Just an update/reminder.  I will be posting a final reminder on Weds or 
Thursday.

We are meeting for Fursuit/Furry bowling on Saturday 5/19 @1pm at Johnson's 
Duckpin Lanes in Hamden, CT.

All are welcome to attend NO FURSUIT NEEDED TO ATTEND .  We have a total of 
4 lanes and can get more if needed.  If you are planning to attend please 
email me and let me know if you are bowling in or out of suit.

I would like to know ASAP so I can give the alley a strong estimate a couple 
days prior.  So far it looks like about 10 are attending.

Bowling is going to be $8 per hour.  Shoes are extra if needed (Most suiters 
will not need shoes).  If We get over 20 bowlers they will cut the price.

If folks need transportation from the RR station I can make arrangements.  I 
also have some crash space here if needed (need advance notice).

The original post with directions can be found here:

Hope to see you there

I also have a foam head. What I ended up doing is making what I call a jaw opener, which is bent from 6 gauge wire, fits under my chin, with 2 blunt prongs that come out away from my mouth a couple inches. The thing is held in place with elastic strips directly to the top and back of my head. Basically, when my mouth opens, the prongs go down because of the movement of my chin.

The foam head then goes on, and the prongs are hidden under some red felt of the head's inner jaw. (The jaw and head are all one piece, but the point of attachment is very minimal, so that the jaw part flops down easily when just a little force is exerted.) So then, theoretically, when I move my jaw, the foam head moves its jaw.

The thing is, I never got it working quite as good as I'd imagined. Even at best, I had to greatly accentuate my jaw movements to get the Jarrell head to move casually. The longer I have the foam head on, the more sweat, and so the more slippage, so that my own jaw movement is wasted on the inner sides of the foam head, instead of specifically on the jaw. What I have, almost, kinda works, but I'd want to do more experimenting and perfect the idea before I ever wanted to try a Jarrell version 2. I too like a moveable jaw because my character is not mute.

Anyone have a how-to or tips on making the moveable jaw?
I was originally going to leave it fixed but starting to think about  
making it moveable -I just have no idea where to start the process.   
I've got a foam face (still haven't furred it yet)
Thanks for any help you may have!

Hey y'all =)

What kind of seam allowances do you guys use? 1 inch, 3/4"? 1/2"?
Just curious cuz I'm about to start sewing the jumpsuit part.
Thanks for any help you might have!

Oh shoot -almost forgot -any tips on the fabric part that extends  
from the head?  I still haven't furred the head yet but will soon.   
Curious how that part works -from photos it appears to be just  
matching fabric that kinda drapes down to blend with the suit body - 
is there any magic length to it?  Thanks for any help =)

5/8" seam allowance is the standard for commercial patterns.  If you're 
making your own patterns, you can use whatever you want.  Personally, I 
stick with the standard 5/8".

If you're using a commercial pattern, here's a hint -- sew all the front 
pieces together first.  Then sew all the back pieces together.  Safety-pin 
the entire front to the back where you plan to sew.  Put the bodysuit on 
inside-out. Then adjust the safety pins in or out until you get the fit you 
want.

As for the head... there's at least two ways to do it.  A lot of fursuiters 
put a flap on the head as you're describing.  Some tuck it in, others 
don't.  But depending on the type of head you have, you can put a 
"turtleneck" on the bodysuit instead.  It blends better than a 
not-tucked-in flap and length isn't an issue either.

Since I use a serger than a sewing machine. I sew the front parts
together. Then the back parts together. Then I sew the back to the
front. Then I put it on and adjust for size. Since the serger cuts and
sews at the same time its easyer that way.

I have found that is better my self also. It gives a better look and
the seam between the head and body suit is not as easy to see acrost a
room. When you turn your head you dont see a big flap of materal
moving with your head.

I'll strongly second the 'turtleneck' idea - when I rebuilt my Santa Fox suit last year, I switched from the flap design to the turtleneck design and I'd never go back now.  It's especially nice if you want to wear *anything* around your neck, since removing your head won't involve having to remove and replace any items around your neck, as would be the case with a flap design.  Since I always wear a bell collar with my fox costume, not to mention normal badges and such, no longer having the neck flaps makes a huge difference when I'm playing fursuit games or doing other high-energy activites and want to duck in somewhere and take a quick break.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

I usually add 1/2" on the pattern where it will be sewn, more as needed. I 
usually handsew, but when it comes to zippers, I'll machine sew. TJ's got 
a good point with extra allowances.

What I've done is make my own pattern from someone's duct tape dummy and 
use muslin for the bodysuit mockup. That way I can see how well it'll fit 
and where the problems may be including zipper placement and fix them for 
the second mockup which can fit and look better than the first. This will 
also have markings as to how much extra to add on or take off and seam 
allowances. It's all held together by large safety pins.

Sure, it takes time, but is worth it and muslin's quite cheap and you can 
reuse it as your pattern. When I transfer the pattern to the fur, I'll use 
chalk and mark what piece is what and where the lay of the fur goes.

I'll usually add on the "turtleneck" part after the bodysuit is finished, 
adding on a spot of velcro for closing. Jarrell's suit had extra on the 
head, so even if he tucked it in or not, he'd still look good. The zipper 
was one of those jacket type of things so he could put on the tail and 
then the bodysuit.

Extra note here on seam allowance, one thing to look at is your type of fabric, usually fur is really thick, so in some cases 5/8" isn't enough on long pile un-shaved fur.  I'd say anything over 1/2" pile, you should maybe goto a 1" seam allowance. Seam allowance is also dependant on how tightly woven or loose your fabric is. If you're sewning something like muslin, it's a loose woven fabric - 5/8" would do fine, but I'd say nothing less than that. If you're doing a standard cotton, or cotton blend, you can go down to as little as 1/4" or less, but not recommended because the seam might break. You wanta give room enough for the fabric to stretch a little bit and not break or rip seams.

:) maybe that was a little too detailed .. sorry!
Have fun!
(Sewning neoprene is a pain in the butt! I'm doing a custom zipper replacement - it's prolly the hardest thing I've ever sewed for my orca wetsuit/"fursuit" it doesn't fit in a sewning machine.)

Thanks so much everyone -this is all great information!
I think I'll go with an inch to be safe then -I've got different pile  
lengths and an Inch sounds really good to work with.  I've not got a  
serger but an old singer that I spin the wheel on by hand as the   
pedal drives way too fast lol.  I'll post a link to some photos when  
I'm done which will hopefully be in the next couple months.  Man this  
gives me a whole different perspective and appreciation for all the  
suits that I see now and especially for you who make them regularly.
I'm sure I'll have another question before I finish this.
Thanks again for all the help! =)

some tricks to sewing neoprene is put powder on the fabric it slides better or wax paper between the fabric and the zipper foot. If you can get a Teflon zipper foot they take away all the problems and sewing should not be a problem. As for seam allowance we serge all pieces first then do a double seam as close to the edge as possible works great. If it is fur then brush out the seams when you are done with a wire brush. good luck.

  Extra note here on seam allowance, one thing to look at is your type of fabric, usually fur is really thick, so in some cases 5/8" isn't enough on long pile un-shaved fur.  I'd say anything over 1/2" pile, you should maybe goto a 1" seam allowance. Seam allowance is also dependant on how tightly woven or loose your fabric is. If you're sewning something like muslin, it's a loose woven fabric - 5/8" would do fine, but I'd say nothing less than that. If you're doing a standard cotton, or cotton blend, you can go down to as little as 1/4" or less, but not recommended because the seam might break. You wanta give room enough for the fabric to stretch a little bit and not break or rip seams.

  :) maybe that was a little too detailed .. sorry!
  Have fun!

    Hey y'all =)

    What kind of seam allowances do you guys use? 1 inch, 3/4"? 1/2"?
    Just curious cuz I'm about to start sewing the jumpsuit part.
    Thanks for any help you might have!

    Oh shoot -almost forgot -any tips on the fabric part that extends 
    from the head? I still haven't furred the head yet but will soon. 
    Curious how that part works -from photos it appears to be just 
    matching fabric that kinda drapes down to blend with the suit body - 
    is there any magic length to it? Thanks for any help =)

    Scape

    5/8" seam allowance is the standard for commercial patterns. If you're 
    making your own patterns, you can use whatever you want. Personally, I 
    stick with the standard 5/8".

    If you're using a commercial pattern, here's a hint -- sew all the front 
    pieces together first. Then sew all the back pieces together. Safety-pin 
    the entire front to the back where you plan to sew. Put the bodysuit on 
    inside-out. Then adjust the safety pins in or out until you get the fit you 
    want.

    As for the head... there's at least two ways to do it. A lot of fursuiters 
    put a flap on the head as you're describing. Some tuck it in, others 
    don't. But depending on the type of head you have, you can put a 
    "turtleneck" on the bodysuit instead. It blends better than a 
    not-tucked-in flap and length isn't an issue either.

Use whatever seam allowance you like for the density of the fabric. BUT. Add
a 2mm zigzag right along side if you don?t have a serger dedicated to pile
fabrics. This is insurance against wear and tear at the seams.

 

I like to use a walking foot machine by Thompson, to sew any thing that
?sticks? to the machine, is more than ?? thick, or likes to slide on you
when you sew with a regular machine. It?s good for leather, vinyl, canvas,
thick fur, and that pesky neoprene. You can get a rolling foot for most
machines that can help with shifting layers. Also use some thin paper strips
along fabric to ease the sewing along. Just put the paper strips on seam
line on top and underneath and it will help get the job through the machine.
Newspaper print, tissue paper, or whatever is handy. You can leave the paper
if it is really thin or just rip it off along perforations made by the
stitching.

 

 (Sewing neoprene is a pain in the butt! I'm doing a custom zipper
replacement - it's prolly the hardest thing I've ever sewed for my orca
wetsuit/"fursuit" it doesn't fit in a sewning machine.)

This is not entirely true. Sergers will typically stitch an overlock  
1/4" from the edge. So, theoretically, 1/4" is your seam allowance.  
Some sergers have an adjustable stitch depth, so depending on your  
project it can be anywhere from 1/8" and up. If your serger includes  
a "safety stitch," then your seam allowance could be 1/2" or more.

I've looked through your presentation, which is a pretty good  
introduction to sergers. I also must agree that using a flatlock  
stitch that you are highlighting your seam allowance is indeed  
reduced to zero. Personally, I would not trust a flatlock stitch on  
fake fur simply because of the loose fabric weave. Tight suits will  
strain the seams a considerable amount and will most likely lead to  
frayed fabric edges and a suit that will fall apart with too much  
wear and tear (highlight on the tear). This, of course, is my  
personal opinion on the matter; so feel free to disagree and argue  
your point. :)


Commercial (store-bought) patterns use a 5/8" seam allowance and  
industrial sewing (manufactured garments) standards use 1/2" and 1/4"  
allowances; depending on where the seam resides.

Me? I sew for a living and I abide by the 1/2" industrial standard  
because that's where my company is headed. The least amount of  
modifications to my patterns that I need to make in order to prepare  
for production, the better.

All I can say is that Alopex's flatlock serging system seems to work well for me.  I have not had any tearing issues.  Of course, I suppose it depends on the quality of the fur.  I've seen some furs with a very thin, light backing, and can imagine it fraying.  My latest fursuit has a rather heavy backing and some 2-way stretch to it, which helps in distributing the stress.

Subject: FL: Saint Louis Pride 2007 *RSVP's Needed*!
Message-ID: <BAY131-DAV131817DBF1B08BBD736034D8180@phx.gbl>

This year Saint Louis will again be having an awesome weekend of activities 
for Pride and the Furs will too!



When? June 22-24, 2007 (yes, I know the other things happening that weekend)



Friday night we will be meeting up for dinner at Qdoba at the corner of 
Arsenal and Grand for those arriving early enough. Then over to Mokabe's 
Coffee House for coffee (it's right across from Tower Grove Park and Qdoba 
at the corner of Arsenal and Grand)



Saturday we will head off to breakfast and then to the Pride Fest at Tower 
Grove Park.



Saturday afternoon the group needs to vote on what we are doing..



Your choices are..



Potluck at the Big Blue House.

We ask everyone to bring what they would like to throw on the grill and also 
a salad, side dish or dessert to share (should feed 6-8 people) We will have 
plates, plasticware, cups and ice tea. If you want anything else please feel 
free to bring it.



Or..



For something a little different this year, going to Incredible Pizza 
http://www.incrediblepizza.com/ for dinner and games. (no plans for 
fursuiting since Sunday will be such a hard day on fursuiters)



Saturday evening we will take a group to the Bad Dog Saloon for drinks, 
darts, pool and socializing



Sunday, we will be meeting up at the BBH at 8am SHARP! and then grab a quick 
bite of breakfast at Hardee's and then over to the Parade route for line up. 
Bob and Jim, two of the owners of the Bad Dog Saloon have graciously offered 
to let us suit up at their house which is just about a block and a half from 
the parade route.



This year we have again been invited by two groups to join in their parade 
entries



Cheap TRX, who will be doing a "Pirate" themed entry in the parade



And.



The Bad Dog Saloon, who will be doing a open community (everyone is welcome 
gay, straight, trans, bi, lesbian) and "Canine" themed entry.





If you want to be in the parade, I need to know which entry you want to be a 
part of!! This is VERY important!!



 If you don't want to be in the parade, it's all good! Outside of Cheap TRX 
is a perfect vantage point to see the parade!



After the parade we will head to Chris's Pancakes and Dining for lunch.



This is an "All Welcoming" weekend. Everyone is invited and welcome to 
participate in what ever they wish to. This means you don't have to be Gay, 
Bi, Lesbian, Trans to participate.  It's just a perfect weekend for everyone 
to get together and have a good time! The "No Drama" sign will be up for the 
weekend.



I do still have just 2 rooms left at the rate of $78 per night plus tax at 
the Best Western Kirkwood Inn. If you would like one of these rooms, I need 
to know by 6/17.



If you would like more details or want to RSVP please email 
mideonwerewolf at gmail.com I need to know which events you are planning to 
attend, which of the Saturday dinner options you prefer and if you are 
planning to be in the parade, which entry you want to be a part of. I need 
all RSVP's by 6/17 so we can plan accordingly!

I have been on here for awhile, and enjoyed many the conversations and great
workmanship that's available on this forum, our shop is currently seeking a
few free lance artisans who have experience with fur suits. Before we look
to the Art schools or Mandy.COM I thought I would post up here.

                 Our shop is located in the central jersey area, so
commuting from Philly or NYC is not a problem please let us know as soon as
possible these positions won't last.

Thanks

Hello!

I've started work on my pattern and am in the process of pinning the  
muslin mock-ups.  I've got the foam leg fronts and the foam "ankles"  
but I'm having a bit of a time coming up with a suitable pattern  
design to fit nicely over and around the foam.  Anyone have a  
specific pattern they've come up with and are able to share or any  
suggestions?  I'm working with the McCall's 8953.
Thanks!

I'm curious as to what company manufacturers most of the mascot cosutmes Fun Folly sells.  It appears that they carry a few from Alinco and Facemakers, but I can't tell who makes the majority of them.  Do they manufacturer the costumes themselves, or do they sell costumes some other company makes?

Thanks for any advice.

Message-ID: <46884C5B.5050103@gmail.com>


While normally an advice column has nothing to do with fursuits, a recent entry 
was about something many people in this list will relate to...

-------
DEAR ABBY: I am a professional costume wearer. By that, I mean I have been an 
elf, a giraffe, a moose, T-Rex and a character for a major hamburger chain. I am 
presently a character for a major cereal company. Once I am in costume, I am not 
allowed to speak.

Adults and older children think nothing of hitting me, kicking me, pulling at 
parts of my costume, and trying to knock me down. One 12-year-old even tried to 
"head butt" me while his father looked on and encouraged him!

I am in costume for about an hour or so before I can take breaks. It gets hot 
and sweaty inside these costumes. I have a limited field of vision and can't see 
many of the oncoming attacks. Even if I saw each one, I would not be able to say 
anything to stop or deflect these random attacks. What I do is have a paid 
"helper" walk beside me. This is now discouraging such actions by adults and 
children.

I would ask parents to please remember that there are real people inside these 
costumes, which are not heavily padded. I feel each and every hit and kick as if 
I were wearing street clothes. Thanks for printing this. -- H.S. IN COLORADO

DEAR H.S.: You have my sympathy, and I am seconding your request. That a parent 
would encourage such poor behavior incenses me. You should not have had to hire 
a "bodyguard" to protect you.

I find it interesting, however, that the children who are acting out against you 
do not regard you as another human being. It seems they have mistaken you for 
the same kind of cartoon character they see on television -- probably too much 
television -- against whom violence is committed with no repercussions. (I'm 
reminded of the "Mr. Bill" character that was once featured on "Saturday Night 
Live.")

One of my assistants, who has occasionally dressed as a chimp in her work as a 
docent at the L.A. Zoo, tells me that this is one of the hazards in your line of 
work. Call me humorless, but to me, assault and battery are criminal behaviors 
-- and if someone I cared about were subjected to it, I would be very concerned.

I'm just curious about something - how many performers here have run into children and adults this rowdy on more than a rare occasion?  I ask because I've done well over a hundred costume character appearances (most of them with my own personal costumes, though four have been well-known mascot character gigs), and I've only twice encountered anyone close to that bad, and one of those times it was an adult egging on his teenage son to hit me, but fortunately the son wouldn't do it (smart boy ;-).  I've had kids tug on my tail and back rather hard a few times, and I've had kids try to pull off my gloves on maybe two occasions.  I've even lost my balance a few times due to overeager kids rushing to hug me.  But, I've never been kicked, hit, punched, or purposely knocked over in all that time, and I know I've logged hundreds of hours in suit.

So I have to wonder if I'm not merely having a really good streak of luck, or if getting assaulted can have something to do with the kind of costume you're wearing and the way you handle the kids and adults.  That is, I've never been in a really cheesy costume, which I'd suspect would draw a lot of negative attention that could turn into beating up the character.  I also find that I'm very good at letting things slide off my back and staying cheerful and playful even if there are some kids around who want to be a little rough.  I learned from growing up as the smallest kid in my classes and from having a speech impediment to boot that reacting negatively and retaliating only encourages the bullies.  So, I try not to ever get defensive when I'm in costume, but rather to react in terms of my character and with a positive or comical spin.  I be a little rowdy with the kids, rather than trying to discourage them, and I think that many times that helps them to see you as a friend, rathe
r than to want to bully you around.

What do you think - can problems like this in many cases be at least the partial fault of the performer not handling the audience the right way?  I'm sure there's going to be bad audience members occasionally, and I'll admit, I could sadly see these  kinds of problems happening more at theme parks or sports venues, neither of which I have ever worked.  But, I have worked a number of relatively large local festivals and community events, and I would expect to see somewhat similar behavior at them and yet I haven't.

And, of course, I'm certainly not saying that it's okay for anyone to beat up a bad performer (although there's a certain irony in that statement ;-) - I'm just wondering if it could be true that an experienced, well trained performer could have remarkably fewer incidents than a poorly trained, inexperienced performer.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

Amen to that.  I attend a ton of kids' events, and you can always tell when 
they hired some schmoe for minimum wage with no experience.  There is 
absolutely NO excuse for acting violently towards the characters, or 
encouraging your kids to do so... but I do think that like any bully 
situation, a lot of it could be avoided, if the character is enough of a 
character to play along and communicate well with body language.  Any time 
you're performing for children, whether it's in a costume or not, you should 
have at least some basic understanding of child psychology, and recognise 
when you are encouraging behaviors with your reactions, and how you can 
safely discourage behaviors with your actions.

Hmm...

I've seen our mascots take breaks and complain that
kids have yanked so hard on their tails that their
backs are hurting...

I've never seen anyone complain about being punched or
kicked, but, it's a fairly common occurrence of having
them tackled in a mob mentality.  Even with experience
adults as escorts, and, veteran performers in the
suits, it's happened.

And, I don't always think it's a case of being tackled
on purpose... Kids have become overanxious in their
hugging a character, and, there comes a point where
they've just plain become overburdened by the numbers
of kids hanging off of them.

But, then again, most of performers are also veteran
athletes (a prerequisite to perform with our team) so
a lot of the violence is possibly brushed off.

Although the interesting thing is... We have a couple
of young kids that suit with us as well (12 or 13
years old) and very talented I might add, and the kids
never seem to pick on them... I'm thinking because
they are the same size!

I was at a halloween party for my campus glbt group in full suit and
one guy in the group came up and kneed me in the balls.  You know what
his excuse was? He claimed that he had thought that I was wearing a
cup.  WTF? If id not been so worried about my suit, I would have
decked him for doing that.  No-one in the group still hasn't forgiven
that guy for doing that to me, I was nearly doubled over after he did
it.

Performance skills may help in some cases but overall
I just think you've gotten very lucky with the people
you've dealt with.  Because in my experience, I've had
kids attack me while I'm in suit while the parents
laugh or really don't care one way or another.  They
have no idea what it's like in a suit or even
understand that their little kids actions may damage a
fairly expensive costume, to them you're just a target
or someone who 'should' be able to take the punishment
because of your cartoony appearance - just as the Dear
Abby letter mentioned, you aren't recognized as human
while in costume, more like a punching bag with a cute
face.

And to reiterate the point, it can get worse when kids
turn into teenagers or young adults - people who you
can't even use the excuse 'they don't know any
better.'  They will attack you as a show of machismo,
for no other reason than they can get away with it..

I know of some fursuiters who will not perform in
public without wearing a cup, that's based on real
experience.  And whenever I have a costume with a
tail, it tends to get pulled - sometimes very hard.  


It's tough thing to go through if you're ever
separated and surrounded by rowdy people.  If you're
set on remaining in character - you can't get out of
suit, you can't call for help, you can't hit back, and
getting back to a safe area leaves you open for
attacks - believe me, I've been through it and I know
other experienced performers who have been through it.

Good performance skills will not prevent anyone from
going through that experience - that sort of reasoning
that it's the performer's fault should never be used,
they're doing a lot just by getting into suit.

I just want to say on this subject, that while staying in character is
important while in suit, it's also very important to understand when the
time comes to break character to keep from getting completely beaten
up/manhandled/having your costume destroyed/etc. I have not had this
problem yet personally, but then I don't really costume that much
outside of cons or holidays.

My roommate had a bit different of a problem at FC '06 when we went. She
was wearing a black cat fursuit with a corset, high heels, and wasn't
wearing her glasses since they wouldn't fit over or under the head (if
anyone was there you may have seen her walking around). We were walking
around with her as her guides, when we got to the front of the hotel
where a bunch of non-furry people were gathered. One rather large guy
walked up to her to get a pic taken, then asked if she would 'indulge'
him. We didn't think anything of him asking that (let alone were able to
hear it really), and she said 'sure' kind of hesitantly. He picked her
up off her feet and held her like a piece of meat for some more pictures
until we moved forward and he finally put her back down. He wasn't going
to do anything near as we could tell, but she said that was still
uncomfortable and weird.

So it's not just people beating you up, people will just treat you like
meat either way from what I've seen. :/

Interesting thread here. I've done some public performances myself, 
including once at a hospital, and that was total fun. At the worst when in 
WerGoyle, when I was sitting down doing something with this one kid, 
another kept tossing a basketball at my back. I knew it was playful, but 
my mistake was ignoring him and he kept tossing. Finally I turned around 
and played a little with him. At one point, this kid with an IV in him got 
a little too close and I knocked him over since I didn't see him. 
Fortunately, he was OK, but I didn't move anywhere til he was safely up 
and his IV checked and still in place.

It's probably this picture URL below that gets people thinking I attacked 
him then a few laughs after they know the background. As it turns out, we 
were wrestling with the ball and I managed to tickle him to the floor. I 
stood up and looked over at the camera in time to see someone (Spiked 
Punch?) take my pic. I think the young kid was the brother of one of the 
sick patients.

We're all not alone on this, and it sometimes worries me. I was wearing 
Mutant Cat at this local state fair some years ago just before I met up 
with someone else. Mutant's tail is a khaki belt with the tail sewn on 
with a waistpack worn over it to hide the friction buckle. A young girl 
yanked my tail so hard, that I nearly fell backwards. Fortunately, I was 
in front of a display booth that had someone I knew, and would have 
allowed me to go in there to hide and check on the tail and myself. While 
the fursuit FAQ/wiki talks of suiter abuse, I'll have to agree that having 
an escort helps out in reducing it.

Santa Fox, you said;

As one of the list's deaf readers, it was the opposite of my experiences. 
If I tried ignoring them or just walking away, they'd just try harder 
until they got a reaction or an adult dealt with them. Around homeroom or 
after PE (outside normal classes), sometimes I wonder why I didn't just 
walk out to go to the library, risking getting in trouble.

I've not retired from suiting, just kinda inactive, due to the condition 
of my knees.

Sometimes I've noticed that having theatre and/or acting experience helps 
in doing performances. I've sometimes done some unintentional visual bits 
of humor here and there. I killed an entire classroom when I brought a 
flashlight and fiber optic cable out of my jacket just as the instructor 
was talking about the same thing.

However, I'm wondering something... If there is a suited performer in a 
wheelchair, wearing just paws, tail, and head, how would the kids react? 
Would they try to climb on the chair, try to sit with the performer, what?

Charators at theme parks get the worst of it. But others get beaten up
also. Down to being stabbed with knifes. Luckily the person that I
heard of that was stabbed lived throe the attacking. But he did not
escape staying out of the hospital. The kid that attacked him was put
in jail for assault with a deadly weapon. I would never take a job at
a theme park. Its not worth the minim wage pay.

The whole thing about the knife attacking was reported here on
fursuit.org some years ago.

Well, Took us by surprise, 341 in AC's Fursuit parade this year.  We were totally 
not ready for that.  

I wish to thank everyone that came out and participated, hopefully the parade was 
better than last year for the route length. The actual parade was only 30 minutes 
long, as we tried to eliminate some of the milage and stops.  

I hope everyone liked the bottles..  I know we ran out of them by sheer numbers of 
people that showed up, but I saw a bunch of them left behind as well.  I wish to 
thank Mrianti personally for saving our butts on the water bottles, as they got 
shipped with the wrong type of lid, Mrianti went out of his way to drive 4 hours to 
get proper lids/straws.  

I already know I'll be tweaking the route again next year, and will take note that 
yes, we need fans in the start off area..  


Any other comments?

Do you guys usually finish your seams on the inside?  You know, like cut one side in half and fold the other side over it and restitch to make it look pretty?

Michel Brassard <jambrassard at earthlink.net> wrote:  All I can say is that Alopex's flatlock serging system seems to work well for me. I have not had any tearing issues. Of course, I suppose it depends on the quality of the fur. I've seen some furs with a very thin, light backing, and can imagine it fraying. My latest fursuit has a rather heavy backing and some 2-way stretch to it, which helps in distributing the stress.

I don't and I'd not suggest cutting it  cause then you'd cut off fur that
you so carefully laid into the seam. Bad idea, sewing over the inside with a
closing stitch though would work, like a serger stitch, but with out cutting
any fabric off.

I depends on the garment I am making. On some pieces, I will run a  
single layer through a serger to "finish" the seam, then top-stitch  
to put it all together. The result is a finished-looking seam that is  
simply top-stitched. I don't bother going through such detailing for  
garments that are fully lined. And, if the garment is just for me,  
then I might not even bother.

I usually don't try to run multiple layers of fur through the serger  
unless I top-stitch it together first. I have more control with a top- 
stitch machine, so I use this as my primary seaming tool.

Other seams, like a felled seam or a french seam are simply too much  
work to bother with when making something in fur. If it's a finished  
garment in a woven material, then I'll use a felled seam.

So, to answer your question in the most roundabout way as possible:  
maybe. ;)

The Masq for Mephit Fur Meet is coming quickly.  I would like to ask if 
there are two fursuiters that aren't going to be in any acts.... contact me 
off list.  I'm thinking and planning something that hopefully will go 
off.  For all of you that have no clue.. you will when you see the 
show.  Planning now can help smooth over the process.  Also, feel free to 
join the MFM Performance list to request help for your act.  Email Blue for 
details. There is plenty of talent around.  Keep in mind that the sign up 
for the Masq will take place on Friday.

It's BIG, it's BOLD, it's VEGAS baby.

It was 353.  I know, cause my suit, Ooga Chaka, the purple furry eater, was the last one in line at the end of the parade.

I'm quite sure there were several fursuiters who were at AC with  
fursuits that didn't make it into the parade.

I suppose the only way to count exactly how many fursuits/fursuiters  
would be to have a way to flag the information at
registration and keep track that way. Of course there will always be  
errors, but it would be the best bet.

Unfortunately, Loriana and I weren't able to add to the fursuit count  
at this years AC :/

Oh -bytheway...
I unfortunately did not make it to AC but heard there was a goat  
suiter in the parade.
Anyone happen to know who it is or have any info?  Also been trying  
to figure out Sophie and Pludge from MixedCandy.  Goats are  
apparently rare and I'd like to meet the existing ones if I can =)
Thanks!

I have a goat fursuit almost completed. All that I need to finish is
puting on the ears and furing the head.

Oh I also need to name him. Right now his name is Gotya Goat. It might
be changed.
Another rare fursuit that is on the drawing board is a rhino. Not named yet.
The only commen fursuit that I will have is Rotty.

furring the head lol! yay
I'll post a link with pics as soon as I'm done.  This is my first  
suit and what an adventure it has been ;)
I can't wait to finally wear it too!  That I suppose will be the  
other half of the fun!
Thanks everyone for all the help too - I appreciate all the tips and  
suggestions -I think Scape is going to turn out quite well =)

  Keep planning for the Masquerade.  It is coming up soon.  If possible, 
try to rehearse before you get there.  If you can't, please try to have 
everything ready to do rehearsal.  Remember that the sign up is on Friday 
night, but the show and rehearsal isn't until Sunday.  Plenty of time to 
work through things over the weekend.  Remember that the theme award this 
year of course is Vegas... Have fun with that.

It's BIG, It's BOLD, and it's Vegas Baby

Hehe, even with a new convention center (if they ever build it) do you 
really think Albany could deal with 2000 plus furs?  I'm not even sure 
there's enough hotels to house that many, though there are new one going up.

Having lived in the Albany area for many years I am simply amazed at how 
they have managed to lose every major con they have ever had.  Granted the 
city doesn't have much to do beyond the con itself (Albany night life is 
limited and most attractions are outside the city) but you'd think by now 
they would realize that Sci Fi/Gaming/Furry/etc conventions can generate a 
huge amount of income for the area and attempt to make it attractive to con 
goers.

Being located on a cross road of two major interstates (I-90 and I-87) the 
city is located very nicely for conventions.  Only a 3 to 5 hour drive from 
several other big cities in the northeast.  I do wish we could at least get 
some kind of smaller con running in the area.  I've no hard figures but I'd 
say the area could handle a 400-800 member convention nicely.  For a furry 
convention however that would mean Albany area furs having to come out of 
the closet which for some strange reason doesn't seem to happen.

Ah well, maybe some day I'll have a con in my back yard again.

I still kick myself for not attending Albany Anthro when it first

Well I for one was not in the parade, staff conflict.

Also same for the meet and greet.

The only way to get a count really would be a question correctly answered at
registraion but well I hate the idea of more stored infomation someplace.

Subject: FL: Quad Suit
Message-ID: <BAY113-F231A99D74F1A61E52ECDD5F1F60@phx.gbl>

Dear Mailing group,

                          This is my first ever post on the mailing list. I 
have recently come accross a problem of finding a fursuit maker. I was 
hoping for my first suit to be a quadrapedial suit, which I do understand is 
hard to make, but I am certainly not a darling on a needle, and have asked 
around many suit makers and so far all have refused to even give a quote. I 
am therefore asking the fursuit list, has anyone had experience of quad suit 
making? I will happily supply links of pictures of the character i would 
like done.

Thank You

Scot Skunk

A placemat? Interesting use for them. I used slippers for a couple 
footpaws and a 'fur sock' to fit my own feet. Camstone and Jarrell here on 
the list use slippers or sandals covered in foam with velcro up the sides 
so they can put them on. Main reason we used those was for foot protection 
to a degree since we've walked on some pretty unforgiving ground. I'm sure 
you've seen what asphalt, cement, and regular ground does...

I've seen various other things used like these;

- dive socks 
- possible to use dance shoes/slippers as part of feet? 
- regular shoes/boots foamed out and furred 
- sandals/flip-flops
- rubber floor mats
- outdoor mats or "front door mats"

Some of these methods are listed in the fursuit FAQ/wiki with a few links 
going to other sites. Has anyone used other methods?

I'm one of the few who has made multiple true quadruped style suits: a billy goat, a tarantula, and a tree frog.  You can find pictures of each here:  http://www.jinglefox.com/fursuits.html

IMHO, they really aren't that much harder to make than normal suits - they just require a little more thought during the design phase, and of course, it helps if you've been able to see some techniques that work well.

Unfortunately, I don't do commissions, and I don't know of any one who does build quad suits on commission - they're still very rare - I haven't even seen another one in person, though I've heard there's at least one or two out in the fandom somewhere, and I know of a couple of people who are supposedly working on building quads for their own use.

I looked at your pictures, and your character ought to be easily buildable by having someone create a normal fursuit with a couple of slight modifications.  First, the arms have to be built to the same length as the legs, and the "gloves" built more like feet than gloves.  In the case of your character, they could be exact copies of the feet, though the inner structure could be different, since they wouldn't have to accommodate a human foot inside.

With those changes, all you then need is a hand stilt for each front leg.  You can buy professional hand stilts, though I can't tell you where - try doing some web searches to see what you can find.  Alternatively, you could make stilts yourself - I build mine from a chunk of pool noodle with a length of 1" oak wooden dowel run through the hole in the center of the noodle.  I then cap off the top with a chunk of 1/2" thick rubber and top it with a piece of 1" craft foam to give me a comfortable fit.  The real trick is that you want your stilts configured to extend your arms to be just about the same length as your legs, so you'll have to measure the difference in your arms in legs to know how long your hand stilts should be.  It's best to do this when bent over like you'll be in your costume, and it's always helpful if someone else can do the measuring for you.

Try running this information by some of the builders you've already talked with and see if any would be more willing to take on your project. 

Of course, you're going to have to get used to walking on all fours - it's not the easiest thing in the world, but it's quite fun once you get the hang of it.  Study real animals and watch the way they move their legs when they walk and run.  Then, make up some rudimentary hand stilts and start practicing at home.  You may very well want to do this before ordering your costume, just to be sure that quad is what you really want to do.  Not trying to discourage you, but I'm very small and very thin (5'1" and 105 lbs), and I know that my lightweight body type has a lot to do with my ability to pull off my quad characters so well.

Good luck, and let us all know what con your character will debut at if you do get him made as a quad, as I'm sure a lot of folks are going to want to see him (myself to start with ;-)

Cheers,

I was looking this over and I realized that I didn't really explain how my stilts
work.  If you can picture what I described above, which comes out like a thick
tube, my hand simply rests on the top of the stilt, the top nestled in the palm of
my hand with my fingers wrapped around the outside (I use the thinner pool
noodles, BTW, not the thicker ones).  So, I'm grasping the stilt like you would
grab the lid of a jar to twist it open.  In this position, I can comfortably rest half
of my weight on the stilts that are in the palms of my hands, but I can also lift
each leg up and move it around, effectively giving me a flexible leg joint at
my wrist that mimics a "knee".

Hope this all helps.  If you need more details or have further questions, please
feel free to ask, on list or off.

Cheers,

Does sleeping in a 18 wheeler at truck stops in fursuit when it could
be physically dangerous count as being a hard core fursuiter?
"Physically dangerous" As in having half a dozen guys help your body
fluids go from your insides to the ground.

If so then I guess I am a hard core fursuiter. I sleep in my semi in
fursuit. Not Just a sleeper suit but a full mascot fursuit including
the head, feet hooves and hand hooves.

I think I am as furry as they come. I have done furry art. *Not
anything that I would think that anyone that is not ought right blind
drunk would think is good. At least that I don't think so.* I am close
to having my first story put up onto yiffstar.com. With more to come.
Also I am a fursuiter that wants to be thrown into the oven in fursuit
when I am no more. Is there anything that I am missing to being a hard
core furry? =b

Santa Fox,

That is some wild stuff!  I was totally entertained by Billy on the  
dancefloor at FWA this year -what a treat!  I'm glad I stayed up late  
to catch that appearance.  I'd love to see exactly how you work it  
(I'm actually the same build as you) -Hoping we get an opportunity to  
hang a little at a con - I know you're a busy guy.  The neck is one  
part that intrigues me.

Scape the Goat is actually now wearable at this point but I'm  
finishing up a few details -I can not wait bust out at the next con!   
Can't wait to meet some of you folks and begin living the fursuit  
dream =)
I'll post a link with pics soon =)

Scape

I'm one of the few who has made multiple true quadruped style suits:  
a billy goat, a tarantula, and a tree frog.  You can find pictures of  
each here:  http://www.jinglefox.com/fursuits.html

IMHO, they really aren't that much harder to make than normal suits -  
they just require a little more thought during the design phase, and  
of course, it helps if you've been able to see some techniques that  
work well.

Unfortunately, I don't do commissions, and I don't know of any one  
who does build quad suits on commission - they're still very rare - I  
haven't even seen another one in person, though I've heard there's at  
least one or two out in the fandom somewhere, and I know of a couple  
of people who are supposedly working on building quads for their own  
use.

I looked at your pictures, and your character ought to be easily  
buildable by having someone create a normal fursuit with a couple of  
slight modifications.  First, the arms have to be built to the same  
length as the legs, and the "gloves" built more like feet than  
gloves.  In the case of your character, they could be exact copies of  
the feet, though the inner structure could be different, since they  
wouldn't have to accommodate a human foot inside.

With those changes, all you then need is a hand stilt for each front  
leg.  You can buy professional hand stilts, though I can't tell you  
where - try doing some web searches to see what you can find.   
Alternatively, you could make stilts yourself - I build mine from a  
chunk of pool noodle with a length of 1" oak wooden dowel run through  
the hole in the center of the noodle.  I then cap off the top with a  
chunk of 1/2" thick rubber and top it with a piece of 1" craft foam  
to give me a comfortable fit.  The real trick is that you want your  
stilts configured to extend your arms to be just about the same  
length as your legs, so you'll have to measure the difference in your  
arms in legs to know how long your hand stilts should be.  It's best  
to do this when bent over like you'll be in your costume, and it's  
always helpful if someone else can do the measuring for you.

Try running this information by some of the builders you've already  
talked with and see if any would be more willing to take on your  
project.

Of course, you're going to have to get used to walking on all fours -  
it's not the easiest thing in the world, but it's quite fun once you  
get the hang of it.  Study real animals and watch the way they move  
their legs when they walk and run.  Then, make up some rudimentary  
hand stilts and start practicing at home.  You may very well want to  
do this before ordering your costume, just to be sure that quad is  
what you really want to do.  Not trying to discourage you, but I'm  
very small and very thin (5'1" and 105 lbs), and I know that my  
lightweight body type has a lot to do with my ability to pull off my  
quad characters so well.

Good luck, and let us all know what con your character will debut at  
if you do get him made as a quad, as I'm sure a lot of folks are  
going to want to see him (myself to start with ;-)

Cheers,
Santa Fox

I made my hooves with layers of foamies spray glued together to get  
the desired thickness.  of course for furfeet you'd probably want to  
use spongy foam for the sides -but the sole I used probably enough  
layers to build up to a half inch and then using "ShoeGoo" i glued a  
layer of heavy vinyl upholstery material and then two more foamies - 
then finishing it off with more shoegoo and a final layer of recycled  
rubber mat.  on the inside I simple built up a little bit of and arch  
and inserted some Dr. Scholl's so If you ask Scape... I'm Gellin' ;)
I subscribe to the "velcro on the sides" idea fur sure - that way you  
can peel the fur off and toss in the wash because feet are sure gonna  
get dirty.

horse boots are that there sturdy with out thickness.

Guys, before we get a flood.. perhaps we should keep this to private
emails? Chances are he won't read them here anyways.. so email him
directly. I just don't want a flood of emails.

Uhm... no, you weren't quite the last one, Lucky. ;) For the last three 
years at AC, and at other cons - I've been making and carrying a sign at 
the end of the parade for both the fans and the suiters alike to know 
"the number of fursuits in the parade." Mostly for fun, but it's helped 
those who plan cons be able to gage the percentage of fursuits to 
attendees, and allowed planners to estimate what's needed for headless 
lounges or other fursuit activities. I think it's also brought many 
fursuiters to the con, wanting to be part of a larger fursuiting event - 
and those who make them, to show them off with lots of others.

Let's face it, fursuiting is getting popular and a lot of fun!

And yes, just a bit of clarification. The count at AC the last three 
years has "unofficially" officially been done by the Dorsai Irregulars 
each year - and "I" use their count for the sign I make and carry. This 
year, it was first conducted as the exit to the outside photograph and 
came up to 341, but it couldn't be verified. So, I asked the Dorsai to 
do another count - and they graciously said they would for us.

So, a repeat count was made by their able staff at the exit to the 
dealer's room. That number was given to me by the head of their security 
detail as "353."

While many say there are a lot more fursuiters at the con (which there 
obviously is) - it's so far been the only count that can be made with 
any kind of regularity and consistently.  Otherwise there will always be 
those who say "I suited, why didn't you count me too?" And truth be 
told, there really is no need to count every fursuiter at every con. 
Even the count for the parade is mostly done for fun - those who do it 
want to know the number  - just to know and feel part of a larger group 
that was in the parade. Although some seem to think it's some sort of 
competition between FC and AC. There isn't really. Of couse if it brings 
more fur suiters to the cons, and everyone has more fun for it... maybe 
it's still a good thing. So far, it seems a relatively conservative 
estimate that 15% of con attendees at most of the popular cons, are 
fursuiters.

And I am more than willing to listen to alternatives, including not 
doing the count at all - as has been already suggested to me. Others, 
want me to continue and have asked me to get Guinness World Records in 
to do an official count at the parade next year at AC (that is pending a 
final approval from the AC Board of Directors, regardless of any 
suggestions.) Truthfully, there were likely over 400 suits at AC this 
year. Likely to be even more at FC when it next occurs. What happens 
from there... who knows!

So, does anyone really care... or should the counting just be ended?

counting is good, I know I always await the final count, and of course it's not perfect but it's a base line at least, you know it's no less then that number in any event.

Ideally, I'd like to be able to register at a con as a fursuiter, thats your only real true count thats about as accurate as you can get

It doesnt matter who's first or last, its good to see that the number of 
suiters is increasing.

Dear Santa Fox,
                      Thank you for the advice. I admit it will be slightly 
harder for me to perfect being in quadraped (I'm 6'0 and 150lbs), but I am 
desparate to be this character, it's almost screaming out at me, hehe.

I don't want this to be misinterpreted, but the count is good for when the 
media suggests that furry fandom is solely about people who dress up in 
costumes, as they are wont to do.  The parade number can be used as hard 
evidence that costuming, while the most visually sensational aspect to the 
media, is just one facet of a larger culture.

I am desparate to be this character, it's almost screaming out at me, hehe.


That is probably the best reason to do it.  And the one most likely to 
ensure success.

Fursuiting is a large part of furry fandom but it is still just a facet. I 
personally am on the fence on whether to fursuit or not. It has been a subject 
for internal debate since my first AC six years ago. My problem, besides 
convincing other parts of my own mind that this is not silly and will not make me 
any less of a man by dressing up as some fugitive from a theme park but is 
merely a facet of my own personality, is deciding what version of my own damn 
character to make. Do I make a lupin ranger, take a geek point if you can identify 
the game its from, a tiger-striped german sheperd pirate, or some canid 
soldier? It's time like this that I really have too much creativity for my own good.

Actually, I'd like to start seeing a count by species.
 Then we can truly disprove those spurious allegations
by the media concerning which animal is currently in
fad.



Though... pull out the abacus to take into account all
those fractions brought on by hybrid species, we may
need an accounting ledger to do this right.

That's right, ladies and gentlefurs.  We will have more action, we will 
have more bite, more spark.  It's all about the Masquerade at Mephit 
FurMeet.  There will be performances to entertain, and to enlighten.  If 
you think Vegas has the greatest shows, then you've never been to the Masq 
at MFM.  In case you have missed all my references, they are all from Vegas 
movies or music.  If you're a fursuiter, you should think about performing 
(it does help to have your act prepared before you get there).  Sign up has 
been moved to Friday night, look at the schedule.  If you don't want to be 
in an act, I am still looking for two fursuiters that aren't in any of the 
acts.  If you just want to watch, PLEASE come and watch the show on Sunday.

It's BIG, It's BOLD, and it's Vegas Baby

Its a fandom. Older furs leave and younger furs take there place.
People grow out of fandoms. They find others things of interest that
they don't think is childish. Furry base will always be the young
people. That's not saying that us old decrepit gray muzzles with are
walkers wont always be around. Some one has to keep the young foals
out of trouble. Or is that to encourage them to get into trouble? I'm
not sure on that one point. None the less. We will always be a
minority in the fandom. The whippersnappers will have to just learn to
go around us old farts.

His Most Royally old and decrepit gray muzzled Highass, Donkey

ps Since I am a donkey and I have always been gray. Does that mean
that I can make up for it by acting like a colt all the time with out
getting into trouble for my antics?

Its kind of frustrating that furs are willing to state that they are leaving
the list but there is no evidence as to why posted.

??? It was very clear to me why Chaka Wolf left. He out grown being a fur.
To be a furry one MUST have some childish part of them self's that wants a
out let.
The only way I will be leaving furry is in a wooden box. And that is only my
physical body. My spirit will always be around the fandom. So after my
passing. If you see a ghost in a fursuit at a fur com that's just me
enjoying the con. Dont get scared just wave at me.

As for furs my age. There are some. I am 7 years old with 30 years of

32 myself,
If you figure that you spend your first 18 under the rule of your parents,
then at 36 you have only been your own person for 18 years... not old at
all.

I don't post much.. I'm not too social with most but I don't think I'll ever
"grow out" of my furry, I will proably always just have my small social
group that I enjoy spending time with and my hobby of making fursuits will
most likely never stop.

I don't think he is leaving the fandom, he's just pissed off at fursuiting, cuz he got burned by scribble on a suit.

i love all of you guys, furry is my chosen family: and i love my family!

hey Donkey, that's the most unique and refreshing way of stating it that
i've ever seen, very salient job <3

i was always fascinated when i saw the ``older demographic'' in the fandom,
because i did come into the fandom generally academically ( i was curious as
to why all my other subcultures seemed to be overlapping ) and at any chance
i could, i'd enjoy to ask the ``older demographic'' how or under what
pretenses did they arrive here :3

now i mostly identify spiritually, but i don't want to force my heathenistic
views on anyone so if anyone is at all interested as to my take of the
fandom, please don't hesitate to ask me <3foxfoxfox

Hi there my furry friends!

I need some feedback from all of you, I need to know what you think about a
method I'm using. It's from my own invention, I don't know if this method
will work or not.  And I don't know if someone has already done this kind of
thing. It's a way to create lower foot paw. This is the sole I want to use.
I think if you take a look to the following images maybe you will get the
idea.

<Signs>
Ah well... Some leave.. Others just like to grow old disgracefully.

Myself - several months short of being 47.  Been a fursuits for about 5 yeats and a furry for most of my life.  Of course when I loved play at being a dog around 3 or 4 I never knew that furry existed.  I was more wolf like in my teens and for the rest of my life.  I was not until I fund a piece of furry art (Thanks to 'The Werewolf") that I started to search on the net.
Sure I saw werewolf movies but they always seemed to be lacking. I saw that a werewolf should be the best blending on man and wolf.. rather than the worst parts.

So here I am.. White Muzzle, Still performing, and with many more years left in my yet. I WILL!!! make it to a con one day. Prob after Virgin gets their Australia to US flights going cheaply.

Take care

Marcwolf

Hi Alan

Very good ideas to get an accurate impression  for the size of your foot.

Not sure what you are using to fill the impression. I have experimented with
Bostik Black Goldsil which is a stretchable very strong silicone filler. I
can water it doen with white spirits for painting.  Having used it in my
hand paw pads I found ti very strong and resiliant.

When I made Marc's new hand paws I use a sheet of plastic , traced my hand,
and then proceeded to scupt paw pads onto it with clay. Then I too a plaster
cast to get the negative and use the Bostic to make the pads.  Wnded up
looking ans working very well.

2 things to watch. Make sure the filler you use is flexible as the foot will
need to flex and move, and also it is hard wearing so you dont have to
rplace or repare every few wearings.

Another things to think about is maybe a piece of thick leather on top
between the soul and your foot to prevent accidents with drawing pins and
other sharp nasty objects.

As said - its a great idea and keep experimenting.

Tale Care

Dave a.k.a. Marcwolf

Well, there's moments of change in everyone's life and
sometimes we go for them and other times we let them
pass us by while holding onto things that are more
memories than an actual part of who we are.  

He needs a break from furry, the drama, the
childishness, or whatever from the fandom or specific
relationships then he should take it.  The door is
always open to return, as much as people deride those
who announce they'll be leaving and then later return
- nobody denies them a place in furry when they
return.  I think it's more about your personal
connection with anthros moreso than with the fandom;
you define what it means to you, the fandom is more
about interacting and being a part of the group mold
of furry.  Leaving the fandom is different from saying
furry no longer plays a part in your life.

So, although I don't know you - take care of yourself
Chaka, or anyone else who has left or may leave furry.
 It can be very easy to forget what brought you into
the fold, or the magic it once held for you, everyone
feels the pulling down that the day to day crap and
petty nonsense as it chips away at what makes it
special and fun.  It's sad but you have to do what's
best for yourself.

I can understand what its like to start growing old in furry.  I'll be 29 in 
October.

I found furry 9 years ago and things have grown/changed a lot.  Most folks 
finding furry these days are younger and don't share all the same interests 
with me anymore.

Despite the changes I still have many friends and still manage to have fun.  
You will hit "social slumps" in furry at times where you feel left out at an 
event beacuse you are older than the rest of the group.

Don't let little things get you down.  Remember there are always folks older 
than you around!!

I'm sure most furs do share the same 'never growing up' tendancies. I know I
do. I'm nearly 30, but I still haven't outgrown my childhood. In fact, due
to what happened to me when I was younger, I'm pretty much making up for my
lost childhood , and I'm enjoying it!!

Being an adult child is more fun, because as well as doing all the things
you love doing, you also have the money to do it!!

I say Amen to that!

I've been furry *all* of my life -drawing animal character pictures  
since before my memory and having found the fandom about 14 years ago  
now, I'm certainly in for life ;)
I've had my ups and downs, disappointments, rejections, I've been  
burned before -but I'm still furry and always will be.  We really are

we can always hug and make up =)

Message-ID: <beded4ed0707301607y7ebd71cndec3b54638381673@mail.gmail.com>

I posted some pics about a year and half back.  And they were kinda
low-res..  So, thanks to furrtek for taking pictures, I have some new pics
of Alex The Lion from when I was performing him about two weeks ago.

Enjoy!!

Hey guys, just plugging my auctions because it's that time
again, my car insurance is due! XD Things have been rather hectic
around here and due to pets, trying to feed ourselves, and bills, I'm
short on my car insurance.

SO! Here's my auctions:



Purple dragon partial suit
http://www.furbid.ws/cgi-bin/auctio.....item=232332393
I will take payments on this one, as long as the minimum of the first
payment is $100. ^_^ If you either choose not to do payments or you get
your payments in fast enough, I know there are a couple furcons coming
up that I may be able to have this shipped out before? Just let me know
the date of whichever one you're going to is and I'll ship it out
pronto!

Partial suit commission
http://www.furbid.ws/cgi-bin/auctio.....item=232333426
There are pictures of the suits I've done thus far on the auction there, as well as more pics at: http://www.freewebs.com/niikufursuits
I can take payments on this one as long as the minimum is $100 plus
whatever the cost of materials ends up being. This will not be done
before the most upcoming furcons, but I will have it done this year, in
the next few months. Here's my queue:

Tauren
Goat
Raccoon/skunk
You!

If you have any questions about anything here, feel free to email me at DasPony at hotmail.com or comment here!

I am looking to make me a new donkey tail. I like the tip of your
dragon tail. What is it made of and how did you get it to stay in the
fur?

Ah, this is but to illustrate the many years of drama and suffering  
lol -though I'm guilty of being absent from the fandom for a number  
of years also -doh

I hope I can make up for my previous time as a fox with Scape ;)

It's made of synthetic hair, and I take little pieces at a time, like the size of half your pinky finger, and hot glue the tips together on one end. Keep doing that till you have a sizable mass of hair bits. Then start gluing them together to form a tuft shape, only gluing the ends that already have glue on them together. Stick the gluey end of the tuft into the end of the tail, glue even more, and let set. Shave the tuft into the shape you want and there you go. :3 Time-consuming and tricky, but it's a good way to spend a relaxing afternoon.> Date: Mon, 30 Jul 2007 17:12:45 -0700> From: donkeyears at gmail.com> To: fursuit-list at lists.fursuit.org> Subject: Re: FL: Fursuit auctions!

Yes that will change a nice relaxing afternoon into a very stressful

Did you use a specific kind synthetic hair or just a wig that you found?

I don't get impressed easily by suits...

But I'm seriously impressed by this guy!

Where did you find the grey furs?  I've been trying to
do an old english sheep dog for a while, and, could
never find the fur.

Thanks1

Let me just be one of the first to say, "Wow!"  IMHO, that is *really* good for your very first suit.  With most people's first built suits that I see posted, I can usually find all kinds of visible problems, many of which are perfectly normal for any person's first attempt at costume building.  But, at least from just looking at the pictures, your's looks 100% professional to me, and far better than either of my first two original costumes way back when.

Kudos, and I can hardly wait for Billy the Goat to meat Scape the Goat.  If we can get Horse's Goat to bring out his suit and get Sophie to FWA as well, maybe we could get a picture of a herd of goats ;-)

Cheers,
Santa Fox

Please show this REALLY awesome goat costume on Live Journal Fursuit
community. I am sure people will love to see it!

I love that you used SO many different types of fur on him.  VERY
interesting looking! I hope to see him in person at a con! (going to MFF
or FC?)

BTW how are the horns made?

Hello!  I posted this to LJ Fursuit list just now but wondered what  
y'all think also...

I haven't ever debuted anything before and wondered what the general  
consensus is of the "furry dictionary" definition of Debut. Not only  
can I not make it to any conventions until FWA08 because of money and  
time off but I also promised my best furfriend that Scape's debute  
would be February.
Now -I've had some friends say that I should take Scape for a spin at  
the bowling alley to test him out -that it would not be considered a  
debut as long as I didn't announce it and no one took pics. Although  
this is pretty tempting, I want to do this right so wondered your  
thoughts on this.

What do y'all consider "Debut" and what can I do as far as "testing"?

Your a little late for waiting for a debut. You have already done it.
Remimber the picks that you posted here? Furs have already seen your

I'd say a proper debut for any new suit is to go to a local furmeet.
Whether it's just a gathering around the TV to watch a movie, or going
out to the bowling alley or mini-golf course (get early permission
first!).  Usually, when I got a new suit... I took it to a nearby
bowling furmeet and debut it there among many furs that know me well.
Personally, I like doing that than waiting until the first con I get
to after getting a new suit to debut it.  That way if any flaws happen
to show somewhere (not that I think you have any, you did an excellent
job!), you can find out about them among a small crowd of furs instead
of having it happen while hundreds of furs watch. :)

LOL!  yeah I guess everyone does know about it now ;)
I was thinking in terms of "live public appearance" though -and that  
will still have to be FWA08.  There's no way I can show off Scape  
except photos until then.  with the exception of the possible bowling  
event in question.  Scape has not gone past the door of my house (but  
once, before he was finished, where his bodysuit never left the box)
I'm thinking y'all are right about testing him out though -it would  
be horrible to have stuff fall apart in the middle of a con lol!
Thanks so much for all the help =)

Message-ID: <134198.17329.qm@web38902.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hey all! Me again!

I have been wandering around all over the place, looking at body suits of some amazing fursuits out there and wondering how the heck i'm gonna be able to create something decent!!

Well, i've more then half way dont with my bodysuit, but i got to thinking about what i could do with the spare fur i have laying around besides sell it.

Have there been any really well constructed two piece body suits out there? Like, using a shirt and then some pants for the style. I would really appreciate the input if this is a good idea (like if i wanted to have the "topless" look but wear regular pants so as not to get too hot.) 

Does this two piece method actually look good, or just lazy and sloppy?

Yeah, that would be bad.  I debuted my suit at morphicon 06.  There
weren't any pics of the whole suit 'til the con cause I didn't finish
it until about 3 days before the con.  I definately loved making the
full debut at a con.  Only one person saw it done before the con.  I
didn't test the suit out per say, and I guess I got lucky, nothing
major happened. =^_^=

As far as i'm concerned... You're suit was built to be
worn... wearing it at events is more important than
the reactions of one or two people.

I'm sure these same people would understand.

It would just seem greedy to me if these peope don't
understand...

Or am I on the wrong track?

My Mistletoe suit is a two-piece, for just that reason. It's nice 
being able to mix-and-match, depending on what clothes I want to wear 
with it. But that's the thing; I always have to wear some kind of 
clothes with it, to hide how the top isn't connected to the bottom. I 
can never go completely "naked" in the fur. ;) So I usually wear 
shorts or a skirt, depending on whether I want to look tomboy or 
feminine.

Also, not as much fur is required to make a two-piece. Sorry I don't 
have any photos online yet to illustrate this.

Happy suiting!
Wendy

Sounds like a comfy style of suit to wear though

My Mistletoe suit is a two-piece, for just that reason. It's nice
being able to mix-and-match, depending on what clothes I want to wear
with it. But that's the thing; I always have to wear some kind of
clothes with it, to hide how the top isn't connected to the bottom. I
can never go completely "naked" in the fur. ;) So I usually wear
shorts or a skirt, depending on whether I want to look tomboy or
feminine.

Also, not as much fur is required to make a two-piece. Sorry I don't
have any photos online yet to illustrate this.

Happy suiting!
Wendy

Hey,
  I did a two piece once. It's true, it is hard to keep it from coming part 
if there is no form of attachment. But I found that a zipper like that of a 
jacket works quit well. it would work somewhat like those pants where you can 
take off the legs. You just have to make sure there is a flap that will fit over 
it and you picked out a smaller zipper other wise it will make the fur bulge 
out when it tries to lay over it. The benefit of this is that if you don't 
think you want to wear the full thing you can wear just the top to just the bottom 
with a T-shirt or a pair of pants the only think to really keep in mind is 
your stretch, how far you can bend before the fur rides up or moves down that 
way you will know where your restrictions are. It can also help to sew a band of 
elastic through the two seams to keep think in place if they aren't zipped.
 
Just sharing a little I'm not sure if it will work for you.

I've done a two-piece design on three of my costume puppet creations (dragon, kangaroo, and stork).  However, this was due to design needs because of their long necks, rather than to be able to wear only half the costume in a partial suit configuration.

What I did in each case was to have the top half overlap the bottom half by about five inches, which gives me the ability to be active without worrying about the two halves pulling away from each other.  I also use suspenders on the lower half of each costume to make sure lower halves don't fall down on me.  Of course, this design looks best if the belly is padded a little bit, as the padded belly helps to keep the overlapped fabric of the upper half from working loose too easily.  Fortunately, with each of the characters I used this design on, a padded belly made perfect sense.

I must admit, though, that I'm moving away from that design in favor of a all-one-piece design (as with my Billy Goat) for my future characters that might have long extended necks, because I've never been that crazy about how the overlap looks.  On the stork (all white all the way around the abdomen), it looks pretty decent, but on the kangaroo and dragon (light bellies and darker fur/fleece on the backs and sides of the abdomen), it's hard to keep the light-color belly sections perfectly aligned when I'm running around a lot, and once the upper and lower belly sections get out of alignment, the misalignment becomes a bad eye-cather that reminds people that it's only a costume character.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

My first fox head was built on a bicycle helmet.  At the time, I thought I was going to like the idea, but over the three years I used that head I grew more and more to want a simpler design.  So, when I rebuilt my fox costume I went with an all-foam head that fits snugly on my head (I wear a balaclava under the costume head for comfort.)  Having used this new head for over a year now, I don't think I'd ever go back to a helmet-based design.

That's just my opinion, and there are indeed some positives to building on a helmet.  It's all a matter of what you want to do with the head and what your personal tastes in head design are.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

I agree with you santa fox.  I did the same thing, I used a helmet in
my first head, but it wasnt what I thought it would be. So reciently I
had the head remade without it.

i like to work with bicycle helmets... but i like a slightly oversized 
caracature head on my mascots... more toony... and the way i make them with 
a lot of airflow gives enough room inside to be really breathable.

Ive only used a helmet once. It was a street hockey goalie helmet for my 
gryphon. The existing cage on the front provided the structure I needed to 
attach the beak. And the helmet was small enough as to not make the head too 
big. (I tend to go toward smaller "realistic" sized). I will also admit that 
I "borrowed" that idea from Legend as his was built on the same foundation. 
Reinventing the wheel takes time and a lot of engineering paper.

For the "toony" style foam head, a bicycle helmet is a pretty good pick as 
the chin strat would help keep the head on and pointed the right way.

I usually work with Balaclavas (nice and light). But for my Drama Llama I
needed something that would hold up to a bit of weight (since the
neck/head were ABOVE my human head)

I used a baseball batting helmet (just like this!
http://www.onlinesports.com/images/mw-abpbhs.gif ), took the lip off of
it, and added a chin strap so I had good movement.

I modified my first Darkstone Realms head using a motorcycle helmet.  Really stabilized things while in suit and allowed for a bit of extra head movement and better in-suit acting.  Also, I wore the suit on my motorcycles a couple of times (only in closed courses, of course...usually...sometimes) too!

I'm having pretty good luck so far with Scape's helmet.  The horns  
are attached with brackets and hardware so they are solid (solid  
enough to headbutt a tossed yoga ball!;)  The chin strap has been  
very helpful keeping the head on with the slight ungainliness of big  
horns too.  fun fun

Hello all,

I've still got some rolls of fur and I'm starting the gears turning  
in my head on how I can make them available to you.  I don't see any  
fur for sale on furbid, so I can't find a good learning example for  
my self.  I do believe that the auction route is the way to go to be  
fair to everyone, but I was wondering though about swatches -I didn't  
buy any fur for Scape without getting swatches first.  Is there a  
good way or some sort of protocol to follow with swatches and auctions?
I'm new to this and confused but I just want to do it the right way.
Thanks for any help you may have!

Scape

Depending on what fur it is you have, I'd love to have some. =^_^=

yes, go to LiveJournal, then look up FursuitAuctions.  It is the PERFECT
place to post pics of what you have, and how much of each type and what
you are asking for it.

Goodluck!

It doesn't matter what car you drive down to Memphis in a week and a few 
days, you just have to be there.  Fursuiters,  if you are there, don't 
forget to participate in the Masquarade.  Just remember that the signup for 
the event is on Friday night (check the schedule).  Also, if you are a 
fursuiter, and don't have an act, don't worry.  If you want to help out, I 
am looking for two fursuiters that aren't in any acts.  And there might be 
a few acts that might need extra furs, let me know that too.  It's coming 
up very soon.. very very soon, so if you have an act, make sure you're 
participating.  See you all there.

It's BIG, It's BOLD, and it's Vegas Baby

If anyone's interested, I need playtesters for the new RPG I invented. I need the system tested to make sure it works, and is fun to play. The website is here http://www.furnation.com/beeaitch

Its to compacted. The way you have it your bogging the play down.
Simplify it. Ditch the point system. Also the equipment weight system
needs some changing. I do like how you have the armor is but not
weapons or misalliance equipment.

pretty simple :)

You didn't. I just found that even creating a character in Ironclaw was a
chore! I just wanted something that was simple and easy.

But to confess. I love Role Master. Combat in RM is quite compacted
but all other skills are quite simple. Back to ironclaw. I do like the
XP system. A game that you don't have to fight to get XP will always
be a good start for a new RPG. Like in D&D how is a magic thrower to
advance in level if he cant kill crap with one pointless spell and he
cant fight his way out of a paper bag.

Does anyone here have experience using Tap Plastics Polyester Resin Finish Coat A?  I'm wondering how long it takes for the smell to diminish.

Yikes!!! I hope you didn't use this stuff in the house. I used this while making my head......thankfully, I did it in the garage. The smell didn't disappear for about a week. The headache went away much sooner.

No, I did it in my garage, but the completed unit
still stank.  Appears to take about a week to clear.

it as a prop.  Anyone have such an item in their geek

I have one in my geek collection but I'm, um... using it lol!
I'd say it's high time to hit thrift shops or go yard sailin' ;)  Ham  
radio fests are a good place to find tons of old fixer-upper type  
equipment for real cheap too.  Or you could make one out of old junk,  
even black tape, foamboard, phone cord -that just gives the  
impression of the prop.

Patch, try calling your local PD. Ours has a box of dead stuff. No one knows
what to do with it, city property and all that stuff. Maybe you could ask to
borrow or purchase for scrap price. Explain to them your purpose and you
never know, they might be happy to help. Also, the dept has a favorite
repair shop for their radios. Check the local area for a radio service
repair. They are also sure to have a morgue with dead ones.
Good Luck

I am looking for a police-style radio with separate
corded mike, like the ones you see police/emergency
personnel wear.  It does not have to work (not working
preferred - I'm spending enough as it is), I just need
it as a prop.  Anyone have such an item in their geek
collection?

Hey all,



I wanted to build a pair of
eyeglasses for my fursuit, but am not having much luck finding any
information in google.? Does anyone have any good tutorials or websites
that can show me how to go about making something like this?? Obviously
I just can't order a pair online, as they'd never fit.? ;)



Thanks!

 Woops... I forgot to change the title when doing a reply to someone elses's message. Not to derail their topic, I'm resending this.? Sorry for the spam there.

I used a broken pair of aviator sunglasses and a wire coathnager to make a 
pair for my fursuits.  I cut them in half then hotglued (yeah, not that 
great) a peice of wire pewteen them then added longer pieces for the 
supports.

Here's a pic.

Nope, its not Billy Boy. Close is not a problem the same exact name is.

I name my fursuits as if there mere animals aka as someone would name
there pets. Not as if they are people that have the ability to
understand what there being called.

Billy Boy is now done. He is all ready to be drooled all over at FC.

By the way. I meant that as figuratively not literally. Billy Boy does not
want to have to wash drool out of his fur.

restaurant near the hotel. This is an "out of suit" event where fursuiters 
can meet others and eat. There have been many similar gatherings at past 
cons.

I have yet to set an exact time or place. I am looking for input on where 
folks would like to eat along with a rough count. The exact details will be 
posted to closer to the con and the exact count won't be needed until a few 
days prior.

Here are some options you can vote on (All are within 3 miles of the hotel). 
  Please send a priavate off-list email to wallyfox98 at hotmail.com with 
your choice:

1) American Steakhouse- Buffet/Steak restaurant that can handle seperate 
checks and has very low prices.

2) Chinese Buffet- We have 2-3 choices!

3) Hometown Buffet

4) Athenian Diner - If they can handle us!

5) Other- TGI Friday's, Red Lobster, Chili's, Ruby Tuesday, Etc.

Hey there everyone, I just got added to the mailing list today! I wanted to
say hi and give a brief introduction of why I joined this list.

Two years ago, 10/17/05, I had the idea that I wanted to be a centaur for
Halloween. To make matters more difficult, with two weeks to complete this
project I decided I wanted the back legs to move the way a "real" centaurs
legs would (back left follows front right, back right follows front left).

Fast Forward 1.9 weeks, October 30th, 11pm. I finished the frame out of
copper tube and couplings/t-joints, had re-created all the joints out of
hinges and springs, and sat staring at the finished frame. Needless to say
the fur-suit that would encompass the frame and myself was whipped together
so fast it looked absolutely horrible. I went to Salem, MA as Pan that year,
utilizing the fur legs and small leftover lengths of the copper tube to
create a pan-pipe.

The next year was very similar in time-line, but this time I gave myself
FOUR weeks, came up with a completely different "locomotion" design for the
back legs involving a large central wheel contained within the frame and
connections aimed at my legs, and the back legs. It worked, but again was
missing the realistic fur-suit and had some minor design flaws. This year I
was batman for Halloween, with the centaur frame and suit laying in my
closet.

Staying true to form, this year, Halloween Season 07, I again doubled the
time to prepare giving myself EIGHT weeks. This year, I utilized a 2-axle, 1
driveshaft, gear driven system. The frame w/rotating assembly much resembles
that of a car. The rotating assembly and it's frame will be completed
tomorrow, and then the skeleton of the centaur and the fur-suit will be
completed in what's left of october!

PHEW, I hope you all didn't actually read all that. So do any of you have a
web-site/ftp-site/storage of any kind with pictures of the creation of
realistic looking fursuits? I would be very interested in such a site.

With all this mayhem, I fear getting in the middle! Well, I figure I better formally introduce myself. My name is J2, my newly founded furry name....Fox Tails. "Fox" because I find them cool, and I am quiet and a little bit of a lone wolf. Although I am more like a wolf, I am small....20 years, 5'5 1/2". Although I act like an adult, I look like a kid. "Tails" because I find Miles Tails from Sonic the Hedgehog to be cool. I am currently waiting to have my Fox Tails furry suit made for me. I live in the Southern California area, L.A. County. You can see who I am by checking my yahoo360 account and looking for J2. J2 out.....oh wait! Fox Tials out!

Subject: FL: Furfright Fursuiter Feast!
Message-ID: <BAY121-W6C6416BA5EAD3257F700ED0AF0@phx.gbl>


It was a tough decision and several factors came into play: votes, price, speed of service, wait times, and distance from the hotel.The Furfright Fursuiter Feast will be held at American Steakhouse 4 miles from the hotel. For those that are not familiar this restaurant is much like a Bonanza/Ponderosa.We will be meeting at 5pm in the main lobby of the hotel on Friday 10/19. From there we will carpool to the restaurant.If your planning to attend please send a private email to wallyfox98 at hotmail.com. I will need to know the following by Tuesday 10/16 (Restaurant would like an updated count 1-2 days prior):-Do you have your own transportation to the restaurant Yes or No?-If yes, would you be willing to carpool others? and how many can fit in your vehicle?Also note this restaurant is mainly buffet style and it requires all that are seated in the dining room to purchase a meal. A soda/glass of water may not cut it and meals range anywhere from $6.99 and up. Please have a peek at the menu before RSVP'ing: http://www.americansteakhouse.com/menu_waterbury.htmlFor those who would like to meet directly at the restaurant our reservation is set for 5:30PM and the address is below:American Steakhouse 



1011 Wolcott Rd. (Conn Rt 69)Waterbury, CT 06705 203-756-7529 http://www.americansteakhouse.com/locations.html(Restaurant is in the Price Chopper Plaza)

Its good to know there are other fellow Furries close by. I wouldn't mind hangin out during conventions. But first things first, I need to get my suit done....I have been looking around to see who offers the cheapest best quality custom suits. Right now I am talking to the suit makers dragonsteel.com and some Noble Wolf guy.

I forgot to mention:
 
This is an "out of suit" event for those who enjoy fursuiting and would like to socialize with other suiters! It has been done at past cons such as AC.

It was a tough decision and several factors came into play: votes, price, speed of service, wait times, and distance from the hotel.The Furfright Fursuiter Feast will be held at American Steakhouse 4 miles from the hotel. For those that are not familiar this restaurant is much like a Bonanza/Ponderosa.We will be meeting at 5pm in the main lobby of the hotel on Friday 10/19. From there we will carpool to the restaurant.If your planning to attend please send a private email to wallyfox98 at hotmail.com. I will need to know the following by Tuesday 10/16 (Restaurant would like an updated count 1-2 days prior):-Do you have your own transportation to the restaurant Yes or No?-If yes, would you be willing to carpool others? and how many can fit in your vehicle?Also note this restaurant is mainly buffet style and it requires all that are seated in the dining room to purchase a meal. A soda/glass of water may not cut it and meals range anywhere from $6.99 and up. Please have a peek at the menu before RSVP'ing: http://www.americansteakhouse.com/menu_waterbury.htmlFor those who would like to meet directly at the restaurant our reservation is set for 5:30PM and the address is below:American Steakhouse

I guess now is as good of a time as ever to introduce myself. My generally used nickname for all purposes- C.Lupus (that is the species name for wolves so it's fairly obvious who and what I am)
It's nice to know so many of us are in the southern california la county area. (not that I like it here- it's way to hot for my tastes- I always run up a huge A/C bill)
In my small city I know of one other furry, but he doesn't make any suits, though he was looking into buying one.
I've been at work for the last 4 months- planning(not to mention having over 10 other long term projects). I've bought a few materials but... I'll get around to making up my mind on a design soon (hopefully)!

With all this mayhem, I fear getting in the middle! Well, I figure I better formally introduce myself. My name is J2, my newly founded furry name....Fox Tails. "Fox" because I find them cool, and I am quiet and a little bit of a lone wolf. Although I am more like a wolf, I am small....20 years, 5'5 1/2". Although I act like an adult, I look like a kid. "Tails" because I find Miles Tails from Sonic the Hedgehog to be cool. I am currently waiting to have my Fox Tails furry suit made for me. I live in the Southern California area, L.A. County.

Just joined! Or more like applied for the group. I have noticed that most fur suit makers charge the same per suit; usually $1500+ USD per suit. It may be a while before I can gain that kind of spending $$$. I should have it by the end of this year....hopefully, so that I can wear my Fox Tails suit for next years Halloween....shoot....maybe even before that!!!

$1500 Who is undercutting the going fursuit prices? If you can find one that
cheep I would say go for it! A lot of fursuits run more than that just in
the cost of the supplies to make it.

*test?* Never posted, bear with me.

I have had better luck with new fursuit creators.  I scouted out for a good few months for folks that needed practice.  Found one that would work for just material costs, and didn't even attempt that (wanted someone with 'some!' experience)

Ended up ^by chance^ meeting an awesome guy at AC and he gave me a premium price of 800.  For a full suit mind, with special work on my ears.. and a movable jaw.  I think he should have charged more if the going price seems to be 1500???

Then again though.. I would have never bought it, would have got the materials and half a'ed it myself ya know?

Mattering on Materials ya, it would cost alot more if you did something really special.  I just had faux fur 13 bucks a yard for it, and a foam based head.  I'd say 1000 is good for a suit like that, any extras... ooh yea charge extra :D

$1500 Who is undercutting the going fursuit prices? If you can find one
that cheep I would say go for it! A lot of fursuits run more than that
just in the cost of the supplies to make it.

Joecifur is an awesome suit maker, his prices are lower than 1500
dollars, they are about 1300 I think.  His suits are really really
awesome, I am going to be getting a husky suit from him in not too
long I think.  =^_^=  I don't know if I'll ever use another suit
maker.

Do you have a web adress to Joecifur??? $1300 is still better than $1500! That leaves me with enough $$$ to buy another MP3 player , or even almost enough to get new rims on my truck  !

Is there a website for this suit maker? As you can see, I really want to get the suit done...cheap price, but good quality. And when I mean good quality, I mean the head is proportional to the body, the suit fits semi-fit to the wearer (not loose), and the teeth and claws are some what realistic (hard plastic and not loose material), and a movable jaw.

Joecifur's site is http://dragonsteel.org/c.htm

There are a lot of really good suit makers out there, but Joecifur is
reasonably priced as well as high quality.

The maker of my suit is part of this list, ask the list for such prices.  I don't think he's taking commisions and I don't have his contact info.. I met him in person.  His name though is Hindpaws, and I would be a repeat buyer ;3  *yep so if you see this Hindpaws, you know I still <3 you for it* :D

Message-ID: <806693.17328.qm@web37915.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

sorry to post again so quickly, but the lowest prices out today is professional sites that make the same suit again and again.  If your looking for something super cheap.. get one that someone is selling, that is used.  

Next?  Go to a place like http://realms.safeshopper.com/24/152.htm?361  (like may not work, but meh)  I went there to see what pre-fab stuff looked like, and it seems it's close to what I want.. and me a would-be suit creator, I'll add to it as needed/possible.

The  next step is to look for people on this list.  If they are willing the prices may be lower, but they will be higher than the above two, mostly due that these are real people with real lives, and the ones that would do it for lower price, most likely aren't full timing it.  Those that full time it are professional based and know the value of what they do.

So for those of you looking for a suit as premium price... talk ..talk.. talk, you may get lucky, but most likely you'll end up paying what they are worth. *grins*

I wish you all good luck on that.

I bought two of the wolf half masks from Realms of Enchantment. They even
colored it different than the standerd colors that they come in. I like them
a lot.

As for the full costume heads I don't care for them. You have to turn your
body to look around. The heads only look forward. Other than that there not
bad suits. They do look good.

I've found that it is relatively easy to mount a inexpensive work helmet in 
a Realms head which allows the head to move with yours.  Though I've got 
much better suits now I still use the Realms suit for certain functions. 
They are a very good starter suit IMHO.

J2 Fox Tails here! - Ehhh...The Realms suits look toooooo much like an actual mascot suit to me. I want to get something a little more unique. I have already been talking to Joecifur, it looks like I will be going with his service. Since I have never bought a suit before I don't know what is cheap and what is expensive....but I suppose $1300 to $1500 is not expensive at all when compared to other web services.

Just an update:
 
I already have a number of folks planning to attend and several folks with car space! If you haven't already please read the message below and let me know your intentions my Tuesday 10/16. I will be giving the restaurant a count on Wednesday.
 
This is an out of suit event open to all fursuit performers, builders, fans, and curious folk.
 
There should be room for last minute folk and I will make a final post about things just before the con.
 
Original post/details below:
 
The Furfright Fursuiter Feast will be held at American Steakhouse 4 miles from the hotel. For those that are not familiar this restaurant is much like a Bonanza/Ponderosa.
 
We will be meeting at 5pm in the main lobby of the hotel on Friday 10/19. From there we will carpool to the restaurant. This is an "out of suit" event for those who enjoy fursuiting.
 
If your planning to attend please send a private email to wallyfox98 at hotmail.com. I will need to know the following by Tuesday 10/16 (Restaurant would like an updated count 1-2 days prior):
 
-Do you have your own transportation to the restaurant Yes or No?
 
-If yes, would you be willing to carpool others? and how many can fit in your vehicle?
 
Also note this restaurant is mainly buffet style and it requires all that are seated in the dining room to purchase a meal. A soda/glass of water may not cut it and meals range anywhere from $6.99 and up. Please have a peek at the menu before RSVP'ing: http://www.americansteakhouse.com/menu_waterbury.html
 
For those who would like to meet directly at the restaurant our reservation is set for 5:30PM and the address is below:
 
American Steakhouse 1011 Wolcott Rd. (Conn Rt 69)
Waterbury, CT 06705 
203-756-7529 
http://www.americansteakhouse.com/locations.html
(Restaurant is in the Price Chopper Plaza)

you can count on me to be there. I will probably either be suiting as Pumpkin (Oberon is his real name), my male black cat character, or as my main fursona Sada Aoko if I have her finished by then :3

Subject: FL: FWD: NJPIRG at Rutgers University NJ
Message-ID: <8C9D9DCF7C31C6D-1518-2CAA@FWM-M07.sysops.aol.com>

My name is Candace, I'm a student at Rutgers University, New Brunswick,
and I've been looking into the fursuit scene lately. I've noticed that
rapidtrabbit and foxwell seem to be
active in the New York and New Jersey areas, and I was wondering if any of
you or your friends could come down for a volunteering opportunity.

Nothing is solid yet, but it's for visibility for NJPIRG's student chapter
referendum. Every 3 years, a referendum is held at Rutgers University to
ensure that the majority of students are in agreement with having a
waiveable fee on their term bill that supports NJPIRG.

PIRG, the Public Interest Research Group, is actually a nationwide
institution, but here on the local level, and more specifically at our
university, we take on projects such as stream monitoring, river clean up,
food drives, aiding with the passage of global warming policies, and other
such activities that the students are concerned about.

As for your role in this, we need some eye-catching ways to attract people
to come vote in the referendum. Sorry for the short notice, but
referendum is taking place this upcoming week, and one of the first things
that popped in my mind is having a field of fursuiters dance for us! I
can't offer any compensation, but I'd be glad to make reservations at a
restaurant or diner for everyone to gather around later.

Of course, I'm totally open to other ideas as well. So let me know what
you think, and if anyone else is interested - tentative date for this would be Monday October 22 in the afternoon, and feel free to email me back at this address candychic125 at hotmail.com

Thanks in advance!
Candace 

PS- I'm making a red panda costume!

I like Oz. He is a extremely adorable kangaroo. Some day Roo my
kangaroo fursuit will be updated. But right now the person that makes
the frames for my heads is burned out on making fursuits. I got way to
pushy.

Well from another Albany area fur, good luck and have a safe drive.

schmaybe more.

You beat me to the punch, but given that I don't read this list but  
about bi-weekly that's not a very difficult thing to do. :)

I'll be there. I'm driving all the way from Oakland. It's going to be  
a grueling 45 minute drive. Damn. It's gonna suck.

Maybe this year I'll actually make a new suit. The old bunny is  
awfully tired and full of burrs.

Hihi!  I'll be at FC 2008, hopefully in my new Roxikat fursuit I've
commissioned from ArtSlave. :)
If my suit isn't ready, I can bring my old one which was repaired for the
most part for my Pawpet Show appearance
on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=MohEH6DgPZc">YouTube</a>.
Last year, I'd mailed my head to the hotel and it got battered pretty good.
:)  The spackle seems to be holding for now.

I am looking for how to contact Patrick Barnes.  He used to live in the 
metropolitan New York area but I lost touch with him a number of years ago. 
Then recently, while going thru and cleaning out some things, I found some 
of the correspondance between him and I and I would very much like to check 
in and see how he's doing.

So if anyone knows of him or whats become of him, please let me know.

I haven't been in touch with him in?almost a decade ever since he quit my TV show and dropped out of both the fursuit/furry community and the predecessor to TMO, all due to various personal issues.?? We originally met at Chuck E.?Cheese's in?Union NJ and sadly, that is also where we parted company.????Long since then, I've been?wondering about him myself and I still care about him.? He had lived in Hillside NJ just outside of Newark.

I am a trucker, some day I might just make it down there. But I will
have to be picked up at the truck stop. Or where ever I can find a
place to park my semi.

Yes I do keep fursuits in my semi! I am a true furry!!!!

I want to say "Thank You" to everyone who RSVP'd. The restaurant is expecting about 30 of us (give or take a few). There is still room for stragglers. I ask that you try and find me at the con before the event in case I need to give them another count. I don't want to surprise them too much.
 
We will be meeting in the lobby at 5pm Friday and carpooling from there. We are leaving the hotel @5:30 with or without you so please be ready. If you are running late please meet us directly at the restaurant @5:45pm (see directions).
 
-Carpool Directions/Coupons will be provided to all who meet in the lobby of the hotel (limited supply of coupons-also on their website).
 
-Please dress accordingly- Ears/Tails are fine full fursuits are not reccomended. 
 
-Remember we will be in public and to act accordingly. We want to make a nice impression!
 
-Restaurant does require you to pay first and since a buffet is included in all meals they will require purchase of at least the buffet. If your not eating or just want a soda you will not be seated.
 
-Beer and Wine are available to those over 21. If you are driving DO NOT DRINK!
 
See you Friday! 
 
Don't forget to check out The "Furry Icebreaker/ Q &A" Panel Friday at 1pm and the "Furry Finances Panel" on Sunday at 10AM (Time has been changed)!
 
Oriiginal Post/details/directions below
 
-------------------------------------
 
The Furfright Fursuiter Feast will be held at American Steakhouse 4 miles from the hotel. For those that are not familiar this restaurant is much like a Bonanza/Ponderosa.
 
We will be meeting at 5pm in the main lobby of the hotel on Friday 10/19. From there we will carpool to the restaurant. This is an "out of suit" event for those who enjoy fursuiting.
 
If your planning to attend please send a private email to wallyfox98 at hotmail.com. I will need to know the following by Tuesday 10/16 (Restaurant would like an updated count 1-2 days prior):
 
-Do you have your own transportation to the restaurant Yes or No?
-If yes, would you be willing to carpool others? and how many can fit in your vehicle?
 
Also note this restaurant is mainly buffet style and it requires all that are seated in the dining room to purchase a meal. A soda/glass of water may not cut it and meals range anywhere from $6.99 and up. Please have a peek at the menu before RSVP'ing: http://www.americansteakhouse.com/menu_waterbury.html
 
For those who would like to meet directly at the restaurant our reservation is set for 5:30PM and the address/directions are below:
 
American Steakhouse 
1011 Wolcott Rd. (Conn Rt 69)
Waterbury, CT 06705 
203-756-7529 
http://www.americansteakhouse.com/locations.html
(Restaurant is in the Price Chopper Plaza) 
 
Turn Left onto East Main Street follow for about 2 miles
Right onto Frost Road. 
Follow Frost until you hit the intersection with Woodtick Road. Make a slight left onto Woodtick Road 
After the slight left go straight ahead onto Frost Road (Frost and Woodtick overlap briefly)
Follow Frost until it ends. Make a right onto Stillson Road (CT Rt 69 North)
Follow Stillson Road for 1/2 mile
Make a right at the end onto Wolcott Road (CT Rt 69 North) (at abandoned mobil gas station)
Restaurant is on your left in the Price Chopper Plaza. There is also an entrance off Lakewood Road (left at next intersection left into plaza)

You can make that very easily. Just copy a canine sized one:) It's
just nylon webbing...

Shortwave Husky (figures, a husky!) makes them, and coincidentally just 
posted an LJ entry about 
them:  http://shortwave81.livejournal.com/57630.html  They're the basic 
nylon type, not the fancy tailored leather type that Jase Husky wears.  But 
I can say that they are strong, as Shortwave used his to pull a car!

I got mine from http://www.adanacsleds.com/, their largest
size harness would fir me out of suit, and only required a
little modification and about a foot of webbing to fit in
suit.  However, it would probably look better made oversize
for a fursuit character.

writing. If you want a space in the Furry Market Place, head on over
to the dealers page at the Further Confusion website and read the details,
download the PDF, fill it out, write a check for US $65.00 and get it sent
in to us.  That price INCLUDES a full membership to the convention. These
remaining spaces are not going to last long, and we will CLOSE sales on
December 1st, 2007 even if there are spaces left, so get your order
in soon!


2. FNL08 - will it be YEAR OF THE NINJA

Time is getting short to get involved with Furry Night Live 2008! This is
the marquee event for FC's Sunday evening, featuring a variety of furry
acts performed live. New this year we are accepting short video segments
to complement the on-stage acts. If you have an act or are otherwise
interested in participating, it is vital you join the FNL08 discussion
mailing list at <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2008/signup/fnl>
(FNL007 list membership does not carry over to FNL08)

PLEASE NOTE: We will be shooting for a rough lineup by mid-January,
and space is limited. Don't wait for FC itself! Also watch for news
about the new website http://www.furrynightlive.org/ and the
"furrynightlive" LiveJournal community!


3. We welcome our second Guest of Honor 

We are pleased to announce the second Guest of Honor for Further
Confusion 2008.  Dave Barclay, of PerformFX will be joining us in
January.  Dave is a professional puppeteer whose credits range from
Cats and Dogs (working as the lead performance coordinator) to Who
Framed Roger Rabbit (the lead puppeteer) to the Star Wars saga
(puppeteer of Jabba the Hutt), and many, many more.

We are honored to bring this master-level puppeteer to our event, and
expect him to bring some of his puppets to demonstrate their use.
Between artist Moira Hahn and puppeteer Dave Barclay, not to mention
special performer Alexander James Adams, we expect this to be a year you
won't soon forget.


4. We need DJ's

We are still seeking a few good furs to help out with the dances for
this upcoming FC in January.  If you like to make people dance, or
watch them dance, or even draw them dance, this is for you.  This is
also for you if you just like music and not really into dancing.

We're still seeking some people who can do real time video mixing.
Wanna be a VJ?  Email and let's talk.  Also, we're planning some new
things this year like Live Action Drawing.  If you want to be under
the spotlight and drawing while listening to the music and watching
people dancing all around you, shoot us an email.

DJ's, we've gotten many submissions, but still need some more.  We'll
be finalizing the schedule at the end of the month, so get a demo in
now if you're interested.  In particular, we're in need of DJ's who
can do non-techno styles (rock, pop, 80's, etc...)  You don't need to
be a master DJ mixer, just need to have a good selection of music.
And we also are in need of some DJ's who can do down-tempo/ambient for
the second area during the main dance.  (And yes, still accepting
demos of every style for all the dances - the schedule has not been
set yet!!!)

If you're interested in any of this stuff, or helping out with the
dances in any way you can imagine, send an email to
dj-submissions at furtherconfusion.org

If you've previously sent in an email, but never heard back from
anyone, don't be afraid to send it again.  We'd rather get 2 emails
from you than none at all.


5. The next meeting is November 10th:

Please come and join us for the next public Further Confusion staff
meeting. Many of our departments are still looking for helpful furs.  Come
be part of something great and volunteer. This con would be impossible
without the help of well over 150 staffers. The meeting starts at noon at
our wonderful Double Tree Hotel in San Jose. Look at any LCD screen for
"Further Confusion..." to see what meeting room we are in.

Subject: FL: My ideas for fur-suits.....etc.....
Message-ID: <366220.98141.qm@web58410.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

I would like to, first-off, I would like to try either a wolf or a coyote suit. (Or something in a catalog or other "informational-books".......etc......)
   
  I don't have the measurements with me at the moment,yet, (I'm using somebody else's computer for now), but, as I've said above, I would like to try "passing-on" my ideas for fur-suits......etc....or just the artworks and technical drawings I've come up with over the past couple of years since I *discovered* the "worlds-of-furry-ness", as well as the others....etc....
   
  (I've looked up in comics and "real-based" books fo all the information I can about the above subjects I've mentioned.....etc......I even tried looking up some of the RPG system games too ------- My  favorites are Rift (don't have any books yet, though), and Werewolf: The Apocalypse -------- You should see my "orders-from-borders", about $350.00 per "pile" or "stack" of books, magazines, comics, and other related materials......etc....)
   
  For the most part I like the statistics and general information for each of the products I've purchased so far, also, the "art" of course ------ I lkie the way the artists "do-their-thing".
   
  (I've purchased things (for Apocalypse) like the "Story-Teller's Screen" (I love *generating* worlds, characters, and other related materials--------I also, of course everybody does, like Star Wars and Star Trek items.........plus the whole genre of science fiction and fantasy-------------------studying each auther's styles and techniques from their books to TV and movie-related items.......I've been trying to get different ideas for costumes. (As I've said before: I love to draw and write------When I run out of one thing (paper/writing paper) I go back to the other mediums------no drawing paper----write------no writing paper-----draw---------too bad I don't have a scanner to show you my *millions* of drawings......some colored, some not.)
   
  Enough about that for now -----------more later as you get to know me (I hope we have a "good-relationship" (whomever I'm writing to----------no, I'm not gay but I like "furry" stuff for some "sexual" and "ethical" reasons --------- probably from my "weird-childhood" and how I got to be this way when I grew up-----------now I'm at "middle-age" (40 years old approx.)
   
  (If you want *my* stats I'll give you as much as I can ------ don't worry I won't ask you for any money like Dafur (I've got 450 messages or "hits" in my file----they drive me crazy!!), unless you offer a catalog or other books, refs, etc.......let me know what's up if you (or I) do anything further)
   
  My Wolf (or Coyote) characters: (at least a little bit about one, the other, or both---for now)
   
  Gender: Adult male (wolf or coyote, maybe a suggestion of another animal or other creatures)----- approx. my age (40 or 40+, or older or younger-----it depends if the character has "signs-of-aging" (crowsfeet, or some-other type of "ailment".....etc....I won't go into details myself, unless I (or you) want to, or whatever. Whatever comes of this!!)
   
  Colorization: (prefs include "real" colors from tan to black ---- descisions will come later on)
   
  Fur thickness: very smooth or very thick ------ depending on the character's backgrounds....etc....) Younger characters have "light" fur while older ones have "thick" fur.
   
  Costume: (if any) ------ character will either be "nude" or "natural" if I choose to have him that way, or, if the character has a costume make it a vest with a t-shirt underneath (white), and, if he wears pants (unless my costume has a tail, or "hole" in the back for a tail), depending on that, I might just "through-some-things-on" myself------unless you've got "pictures" and/or "attatchments" to send me or let me know what Ideas you've had (and others) over the years since you've started.....etc.....) (I'll let you know what I want------if/when I want to know things).
   
  Accessories: old-weapons, Star Wars or Star Trek props (I've got two "defunct" communicators from the old series and a "defunct" "phaser-2" (what Kirk and Spock carry on their "away-missions"--------plus I've got a whole lot of sound effect and music CD's------mostly from the "above", as well as "Dr. Demeto" stuff and Disney recordings and movies------------I like stuff like that-----I've also got a whole collection of art books (for both "real" and "imaginary" character refs.........I miss some of the "un-related" game books I've had------I moved----they didn't!! (I no longer trust my "direct-relatives"-------they "robbed-me-blind" or threw things I away when I went away to school.......etc....untrustworthy!! I've been "trying-to-get-all-my-books-back" the "hard-way": just looking up what I've had and adding on some more materials....etc.....) As Stan Lee says in his "mail-bag"----- 'Nuff said!!)
   
  ***** You can tell what I like when I make reffs to different things *****
   
  Background: (I've got millions of them, depending on my characters of old to the present ones.......etc.....I'll let you know a few at a time------otherwise I'll be "blowing-your-mind" too!!)
   
  (Some of my characters are "post-apocalyptic", "genetic-lifeforms", and/or "werewolf-hybrids"---------I've studied most of the "real" animal species too, to get that sort-of information....etc.....other characters are just "regular"-----like cartoon and/or comic-book-style characters--------most of the ideas are 1. My own, and 2. things I've gotten out of libraries, bookstores, and other "places-of-knowledge".....etc....you should see my *collection* ------ its "VERY-HUGE"!!! (depending on the "buying/selling-processes" I've got and "finagled" over the years......bit-by-bit its gotten large and larger------If I move again, hopefully not for a long time, I'm going to photo-copy and put my texts and drawings on my computer-links (general, no internet at my house yet), and put them inside a *HUGE* archive-stack for wherever I go in this life ----- I'll stop off and pick up my fur-suit in the mean-time too, wherever it will be made, and/or purchased by me------I'm also
 *Dying" to go to a "Fur-Con" or other type of convention----but, as I've mentioned before, in another place, I live in a place called Keene, New Hampshire (deep in the heart of the "backwoods" territories. There's cities and towns around but the people around here still like to use "apples and oranges" for their computers and othe things------I also love the way everybody still uses "Netscape-Navigator" for internet "blogging" -----I've been around----I know what's out there, in the "Great-Beyond"!! Apple2E's are so much fun ----- I also like using the "Happy-Macs" they have at the local colleges and schools around here ------ a sort-of "techno-western-motif")
   
  The "background" itself:
   
  Character 1: A large male wolf (or coyote, or other animal-form).....................
   
  (For this "experiment" I'll choose a "tan" fur color, bushy body-hairs and a large bushy tail at the back -------- for the "facial-features" I'd like a "big-bad-wolf" motif: "My what big ears, eyes, nose, snout, teeth, mane, and other "features".....etc....naked or clothed.....etc....)
   
  (The character is kind of like me---the same kind of "regular-muscular" motif ----- I don't work out that much but I do excersice a lot ------- walking and "hanging-out-with-my-friends" downtown--------just the way a "phase 1" character would look ---- unless I specify anything different-------I'll try to get you some "PG-rated" (clothed) pictures of myself-----through attatchments or "postal-mails" ---- or I'll just describe things as I want them....etc....)
   
  (The character is single ----- unless he looks into "Animal E-Harmony" ---- 29 dimensions of "beastiality" ------ see the "local-zoos" for mor details.....etc.....he might ask for a "girlfriend" at somepoint. Character does not wish to have "relatives" mentioned at this time,as of yet)
   
  More information later -------- I've got to go because I was "told" to "vamoose!!" by the person "running" the organization that I'm using ---- they all frown on people using other applications on the web ----- like "non-job" ones.........I wish I had the web at home, but I don't!! Sorry!!)
   
  (I'll give you "my-regs" later, in a letter or email......or whatever!!)
   
  As I say to everybody:
   
  Buy, bye, and reply!!
   
  (Until the "next-dimension)......

That was quite a bit for me to read considering I just woke up. *smirk* To 
say the least I have a pretty good idea of what sort of person you are. I don't 
think it was all necessary but the effort and though is greatly appreciated, 
shows you care. as far as who you are writing to, I should think you know me 
but with all that perhaps not. I'm Omen and I will be your fursuit builder this 
evening (waitress joke...cheesy I know) But if you are looking for a wolf or a 
coyote either is fine by me all I really need is your reference sheet and the 
measurements and such. I'm fully open for commissions. it was fun reading 
your back ground stories and such.

Fellow Doo Dahers:
 
It's my sad duty to report that there will NOT be a 31st Occasional
Pasadena Doo Dah Parade this calendar year as it has been postponed for
unknown reasons until Sunday the 20th of January 2008 (the Sunday before
Further Confusion 2008).
 
Despite this inconvenience I do plan on organizing the Coast to Coast
Critters group for this new date if enough interest exists.  In the mean
time, who's up for a "What the Heck, Let's Get Together For Lunch
Anyway!" gathering in Old Pasadena on the old Doo Dah Parade date (Sunday
18 November)?  If interested, contact me off-list at dlely at juno.com

Never heard of Shopper's Sunday either! Not cool to just dump a tradition for something like this. The Doo Dah PArade is like Rodney Dangerfield, it gets no respect!

I'm Omen and I will be your fursuit builder this evening (waitress joke...cheesy I know) But if you are looking for a wolf or a coyote either is fine by me all I really need is your reference sheet and the measurements and such. I'm fully open for commissions. it was fun reading your back ground stories and such.
It really isn't a coyote or a wolf though....My character looks like a wolf and a dog but has properties of a scalies through the body and etc. So my character is a Digimon which is representative of the term Hybrid. 

Unfortunately, I don't know who you are n_n; >> Am I supposed too?

Pixar is a part of Disney so could be Disney World.  I
remember seeing pics of the suits when the movie
premiered, they're very nicely made.  Wish I'd seen
some suits of Surf's Up characters too.

These pictures were taken at Disneyland in Anaheim. ?I can recognize the buildings of New Orleans Square in the background.

opinion, is rather cool.;-D).. I thank you for that.  I also do updates 
from time to time to make my website bigger and better.  If you'd like 
to know when I do, join Ba'ar's fan club.  It's a free mailing list that 
lets you know when I do update the site and what I've done to make the 
site even better than before. It's easy and best of all free.   Just 
send e-mail to baarsfanclub-subscribe at googlegroups.com (or if you prefer 
go to my website, click on the 'Ba'ar's Fan Club' link and follow the

1.  Pre-Registration closes December 30th

Just a reminder that with the holidays fast approaching, the deadline for
pre-registration cutoff is 11:59pm (Pacific time) December 30th.

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2008/registration>


2.  FCTV Needs Your Help

FCTV is seeking staff to help with our production at Further Confusion
2008! If you have any experience in any of the following areas, please
send a short blurb about your skills to fctv at furtherconfusion.org. We are
looking for the following:

- Camera Operators
- Video Switcher Operator (aka, Technical Director)
- Technical Assistant

We're mostly looking for camera operators. This will mostly entail you
operating a camera on a tripod. You must be able to follow directions from
the director on a headset and know how to smoothly pan, tilt and zoom a
camera when you're on "Live". We will need you during most of the main
events happening at main stage. Provided we have enough volunteers for
camera, you won't need to be on a camera at all events (unless you want to
be).

We also need camera operators to do handheld video for events such as
Critter Olympics and other panels as needed. This means you should have a
steady hand if you're doing something where a tripod is not applicable,
and be able to keep a reasonable shot at other times if you are on a
tripod

For Video Switcher, we need someone who can operate a video switcher
(Training can be provided, but prior experience is a big bonus) and follow
directions from the director. This basically means you listen to the
director to tell you which camera to switch to, and switch to that camera
when told. In some circumstances, when the director is not available, the
video switcher will need to make their own decisions about which camera to
go to.

Technical assistant will help FCTV Lead and/or Second with technical
related tasks. This may include running cables, hooking up equipment and
running tapes and batteries around to camera operators during a live
performance.


If any of these things sound interesting to you, and you can spare some
time (Even if for just 1 event), please email fctv at furtherconfusion.org.


3.  Furry Night Live '08 - Ninja Master seeks disciples

Ninja SUMMON! We are seeking intrepid souls who are organized, punctual
and silent to fill our Stage Ninja Dojo. Please contact us at
fnl at furtherconfusion.org

Furry Night Live 2008 approaches quickly! FC's Sunday evening stage show
features a variety of furry acts performed live. New this year we are
accepting short video segments to complement the live on-stage acts. If
you have an act or are otherwise interested in participating, it is vital
you join the FNL08 discussion mailing list at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2008/signup/fnl>

PLEASE NOTE: We will be shooting for a rough lineup by mid-January, and
space is limited. If you have any special requirements beyond plain CD/DVD
playback - live audio, instruments, or other custom audio sources, be sure
to contact us at fnl at furtherconfusion.org or we may not be able to fulfill
your needs. Don't wait for FC itself! Also watch for news about the new
website <http://www.furrynightlive.org/> and the "furrynightlive"
LiveJournal community!


4.  Art Show is Sold Out

General space in the art show is sold out. Any new applications may be put
onto our waiting list in case panels open up later on. Also, if you intend
to bring art to the show "just in case", please e-mail us at
artshow at furtherconfusion.org so we can plan, and keep you informed.


5.  Furry Market Place almost Sold Out

The Furry Market Place is almost sold out. Sales will close on December
1st, 2007. At the time of this writing there are only 3 spaces left.


6.  Species Track Panel Information

For all you species panel enthusiasts, we have 12 different panels this
year.  All the regulars will be represented, including aquatic furs,
avians, canines, dragons & scalies, felines, foxes, hybrid furs,
minotaurs, and rodents. But we've also got two new ones:  Gryphons and
Rabbits.  Panels begin Thursday evening at 9pm with the last one ending on
Sunday at 3:30pm.  Come and enjoy both fact and fiction, fans and
specialists!


7.  Would you like to take a survey?

Further Confusion Gaming needs you! This year will feature the FC debut of
Fur-mily Feud, and we need survey answers! The first set of questions has
already been posted to the 'furcon' LiveJournal and our forums (at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/forums/>), and a new set will be posted
every Thursday. Every answer you give us helps us put on a great show!
Also, starting in December, FC Gaming will start accepting applications
for five-player teams to play Fur-mily Feud live at FC! You don't want to
miss this great new show!  Details for how to apply will be posted
separately. 


8.  Further Confusion 2008 in Second Life

If you play SecondLife be sure to come visit our beautiful themed club
house on Critter Valley at (164, 162, 22). Get your free tee shirts from
the vendors in our information kiosk, collect the whole set! Join our
group "FURther CONfusion"(note the spelling) - its free too! Come
enjoy a variety of games in our games park just over the bridge to the
south of the club house area.


9.  Next Public Meeting

Our next staff meeting will be December 15th starting at noon in the San
Jose Doubletree. Come be part of something great and volunteer. Look at
any LCD screen for "Further Confusion..." to see what meeting room we are
in.

Good Morning Friends,

I haven't read the news yet, or listened to the radio to hear about this
reported virus, but just in case:

Michael, do you have a disk I could borrow to run anti-virus on my
school computer.....I know it is infected in the Microsoft suite.

Thanks and a hug to each of you,

Mary 


Anyone-using Internet mail such as Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL and so on. 

This information arrived this morning, Direct from both Microsoft and
Norton. 

Please send it to everybody you know who has access to the Internet. 

You may receive an apparently harmless e-mail with a Power Point 
presentation ' Life is Beautiful '

If you receive it DO NOT OPEN THE FILE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE S, 
and delete it immediately.

If you open this file, a message will appear on your screen saying: 

'It is too late now, your life is no longer beautiful.' 

Subsequently you will LOSE EVERYTHING IN YOUR PC, and the person who
sent it to you will gain access to your name, e-mail and password. 

This is a new virus which started to circulate on Saturday afternoon. 

AOL has already confirmed the severity, and the anti virus software's
are not capable of destroying it.

The virus has been created by a hacker who calls himself 'life owner.' 

PLEASE SEND A COPY OF TH IS E-MAIL TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS, and ask them to
PASS IT ON IMMEDIATELY!

  that is what google is for    http://www.google.com   using the search term

Good Morning Friends,

I haven't read the news yet, or listened to the radio to hear about this
reported virus, but just in case:

Michael, do you have a disk I could borrow to run anti-virus on my
school computer.....I know it is infected in the Microsoft suite.

Thanks and a hug to each of you,

Mary 


Anyone-using Internet mail such as Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL and so on. 

This information arrived this morning, Direct from both Microsoft and
Norton. 

Please send it to everybody you know who has access to the Internet. 

You may receive an apparently harmless e-mail with a Power Point 
presentation ' Life is Beautiful '

If you receive it DO NOT OPEN THE FILE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE S, 
and delete it immediately.

If you open this file, a message will appear on your screen saying: 

'It is too late now, your life is no longer beautiful.' 

Subsequently you will LOSE EVERYTHING IN YOUR PC, and the person who
sent it to you will gain access to your name, e-mail and password. 

This is a new virus which started to circulate on Saturday afternoon. 

AOL has already confirmed the severity, and the anti virus software's
are not capable of destroying it.

The virus has been created by a hacker who calls himself 'life owner.' 

PLEASE SEND A COPY OF TH IS E-MAIL TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS, and ask them to
PASS IT ON IMMEDIATELY!

that's a completely valid and understandable justification but...
it's very simple to ask to verify something is legit before posting a
virus scare...

it would be like if i posted ``george bush was impeached!"  other
people would check the internet first to see if my information was
valid before celebrating/mourning... ( i ``cater to all likes and
dislikes and levels of knowledge'' )

<3foxfoxfox

I  don't mean this in any diminutive or condescending manner.. or regard :D

Good Morning Friends,

I haven't read the news yet, or listened to the radio to hear about this
reported virus, but just in case:

Michael, do you have a disk I could borrow to run anti-virus on my
school computer.....I know it is infected in the Microsoft suite.

Thanks and a hug to each of you,

Mary 


Anyone-using Internet mail such as Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL and so on. 

This information arrived this morning, Direct from both Microsoft and
Norton. 

Please send it to everybody you know who has access to the Internet. 

You may receive an apparently harmless e-mail with a Power Point 
presentation ' Life is Beautiful '

If you receive it DO NOT OPEN THE FILE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE S, 
and delete it immediately.

If you open this file, a message will appear on your screen saying: 

'It is too late now, your life is no longer beautiful.' 

Subsequently you will LOSE EVERYTHING IN YOUR PC, and the person who
sent it to you will gain access to your name, e-mail and password. 

This is a new virus which started to circulate on Saturday afternoon. 

AOL has already confirmed the severity, and the anti virus software's
are not capable of destroying it.

The virus has been created by a hacker who calls himself 'life owner.' 

PLEASE SEND A COPY OF TH IS E-MAIL TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS, and ask them to
PASS IT ON IMMEDIATELY!

There's no intention to be mean about it on most people's side, but the 
forwarding of these fake email virus warnings causes unnecessary concern, 
miseducation and, in the days before spam was a big deal, were considered 
major drains on limited network traffic.

The fact is that education is always better than "better safe than sorry". 
It's more than okay to make a mistake, the point is to learn from it.

There are a few key phrases that pretty much all the social viruses (so 
called because they spread only by convincing people to pass them on) 
contain.

The biggest giveaway tends to be the encouragement to send copies to 
everyone you know! Seeing that is usually a good sign that you should 
investigate further before taking action.

Generic greetings like the "good morning friends" in this one is a good 
indicator.

Almost all of them include a phrase like "this information came directly 
from [insert big official sounding names here]". The FCC is often cited 
which is a dead giveaway since the FCC doesn't issue virus warnings. This 
one didn't have that at least. If you aren't certain, it's pretty easy to 
visit the sites of the companies listed (Microsoft, AOL, etc) and check 
for any warnings.

This sort of thing has been around as long as electronic communications. 
If you're interested in history of the email variants, do a web search on 
the classic "GoodTimes Virus".

Unfortunately the internet is a dangerous place today. These were once 
just mildly annoying experiments in human behaviour, and mere jokes. Today 
the lessons learned are actively used by criminals to coerce people to 
install and spread malware. Even if you don't have anything on your 
computer that seems valuable to you, every machine on the net is useful to 
them - if they can get into it. I would urge anyone using the internet to 
educate themselves - to not do so is a disservice to yourself and others.

There are a few good rules of thumb when dealing with these issues.  If it
sounds suspect, then it is.  If the email address the email is coming from
sounds spammy, and/or is not a member of your friends or family, it's
probably fake.  Also, most email hosts, including Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail,
MSN, and many others offer free email virus scanning.  If you're worried
about viruses, get a good antivirus.  Among the best free antiviruses are
AVG and Antivir.  There are also several good pay antiviruses, like McAfee,
Norton, and recently voted the best, Kaspersky.  Just be careful with those,
since they tend to want to block off things that aren't viruses, like games
that connect to the internet, chat clients, and sometimes even Microsoft
apps.  I've used them all.  Currently, I use the free AVG Personal Antivirus
aka AVG Free Edition.  Like many have said.  A little education saves face,
and saves grief.

Believe it or not, FWA is less than three months away now, and that time is going to fly by with all of the winter holidays coming up. So, that means it's time to start thinking up ideas for the third annual Furry Weekend Atlanta Furry Variety Show!

To make it easier for interested performers to find other performers for acts, or to just bounce ideas around without making them completely public, I've set up a mailing list for FVS planning:

  http://groups.google.com/group/fwa-fvs

If you are coming to FWA and want to be in the show, just go to that page and request membership, and I'll approve you as quickly as I can. Details on the show and guidelines for variety show acts can be found here:

  http://www.furryweekend.com/varietyshow

I would like to get notice of any planned acts as early as possible, so if you're planning something, please join the mailing list and post your ideas there. If you really want to keep your idea top-secret, just send your information directly to me as soon as you have it ready.

Thanks and Cheers,
Santa Fox
FWA Furry Variety Show & Fursuiting and Pawpetry Track Director

Message-ID: <8CA01BA976AAAB2-149C-27E9@MBLK-M35.sysops.aol.com>

I would like to take this opportunity to formally apologize to everyone on these lists for sending out the virus warning.? I am a high school teacher, not in the high tech industry.? This e-mail was forwarded to everyone in my district.? Usually stuff like that gets in the spam filter, but this one didn't, so I thought it was quite urgent.? I don't keep up with virus warnings since I use Macs.? But I do have a PC at school.

I sincerely apologize if I offended or irritated anyone.? I will permanently butt out of any computer affairs and leave it to the experts.? I was just trying to help, but I ended up pissing off more people, so again, I'm very, very sorry and I promise that it will never happen again.? I have learned my lesson.

Minnie

I just spent some quality time updating the Performance section of the fursuiting Wiki:

  http://fursuit.org/wiki/doku.php?id=fursuit:performance

After sorting through it all, I found that there's still a lot of holes and a lot of things about performance that could be said but haven't been said.  I've contributed to some areas, but I can't do it all by myself.

Remember that if you are on this mailing list, you can log into the Wiki and make updates.  If you have useful information to share about fursuits and fursuiting (building, performance, or other related topics) and it's not already in the Wiki, please consider contributing so that everyone can benefit.  If you've forgotten how to access the Wiki for editing, just go to the 'FURSUIT member private web page' link on the main www.fursuit.org page, and follow the link that reads "Chick Here to Log into the Wiki to edit it".  You'll need your fursuit mailing list email address and password to login.

If you want to contribute, but just aren't the Wiki type, please don't let that stop you.  Send me your contributions off-list, and I'll happily Wikify them for you and put them into the right sections.  This Wiki is a already good resource, but with a little proper care and feeding, it can become a really great resource for everyone :-)

Thanks and Cheers,
Santa Fox

After sorting through it all, I found that there's still a lot of holes and a lot of things about performance that could be said but haven't been said.  I've contributed to some areas, but I can't do it all by myself. 

Remember that if you are on this mailing list, you can log into the Wiki and make updates.  If you have useful information to share about fursuits and fursuiting (building, performance, or other related topics) and it's not already in the Wiki, please consider contributing so that everyone can benefit.  If you've forgotten how to access the Wiki for editing, just go to the 'FURSUIT member private web page' link on the main www.fursuit.org page, and follow the link that reads "Chick Here to Log into the Wiki to edit it".  You'll need your fursuit mailing list email address and password to login. 

If you want to contribute, but just aren't the Wiki type, please don't let that stop you.  Send me your contributions off-list, and I'll happily Wikify them for you and put them into the right sections.  This Wiki is a already good resource, but with a little proper care and feeding, it can become a really great resource for everyone :-) 

Thanks and Cheers,
Santa Fox

well to be honest the wwgfd (what would gorman freeman do) comes from a
glorious game called half life.  it's an fps with a crazy physicis engine
and the first weapon you ever get...is a crowbar.   so basicly the question
is, "what would gorman freeman hit in the face with a crowbar?" :P so i'm
putting down the ppl who try and set fursuiters on fire (btw i've been one
of thsoe fursuiters.  and thankgod i knew the person..ex friend of mine...
acuse well he tried it, and well if you ever wanted to see a large kangaroo
nail some one hard in the crotch...well there you had it.  he had to go to
the hospital and get stitches.   i wasn't even kind enough to give him a
ride there, i was totaly fet up and now there's a restraining order ^.^)

I have found that horses and asses react alright for the most part. All you
have to do is give them time to get use to the idea that your not a threat.
Equines are quite qureas and will not take to long to want to see what the
fursuit is. All you need is space and time. Like all animals if you go right
up to them they will think of you as a treat and will try to run away or if
they cant do that they will attack

Hi Folks
I have not posted for a while due to work.

Anyway - for some of the more technical furs I have a couple of idea's

One of the problems  of wearing a fursuit and wanting to put animatronics
into it is controlling them. With professional special effects companies you
can have teams of people with remote control units activating the servo's.
But if your are one person then it becomes much more difficult. Especially
when trying to act in the suit as well.

One possibility is voice recgonition. There are sever small self contained
kits out there. I have found this one
http://www.active-robots.com/products/accessories/speech.shtml which can
handle 20 to 40 words.

The codes relating to these words are send output via an serial port.

The words you use do NOT have to me real words. You can program whines,
growls, snorts and any other 'sound' you want and the system can be taught
to recognise them.

I have mentioned PicAXE's before. These are brilliant little chip that you
can program in BASIC. They have a lot of instructions for handling Servo's
and Stepping motors, as well as a lot of other I/O functionality.

This is great for working with upto 4 or 5 servo's.

If you want  more then there is this fellow..
http://www.robotshop.ca/home/suppliers/devantech-en/devantech-sd21-servo-con
troller.html  This can controll upto 21 servo's.  One very nice feature is
that you can set it to move a servo from point A to B in X milliseconds.
This will take a lot of load off programming various sequences etc.

To use it you can drop in either a BASIC-Stamp, or a 18X PicAXE and it will
run happily using the I2C bus.  Addin memory is easy as you can wire up
serial EEPROMS.

Programming concepts.

What I was thinking of was this - setting up the memory as a continious bank
from 0 to XXXX.  The first 20 locations are set as jump points to the
sequences.

i.e.

Position 1 = 256  = From Locatin 256 is the seguence for command 1.

With care and control bytes you can do a lot including a psuedo language for
loops, pauses, etc. The rest is your imagination.

I hope some of my idea's will give folks a way to solve problems etc.

Take Car

(BTW, first time posting, and love your website, Marcwolf)

Has anyone tried something somewhat automatic, where you don't have to 
conciously control them? I remember you mentioned a tail that swayed, 
but I'm thinking for head controls. For example, with a 6 
degree-of-freedom sudden motion sensor (like what's in the wii remote 
and some laptops) installed in the head, you could tell head movement 
control the eyes with it.

A sudden turn to the left or right typically implies looking in that 
direction, so the character's eyes moving that way would be natural. 
Similarly, looking up for wider eyes, looking down for closed eyes.

Another control would be small cheap microphones, one in each costume 
ear. Not only for improved hearing in costume but polling at even 1kHz 
would be enough to determine noise level.

If things are louder to the left, the left ear could swivel as if trying 
to hear. If things are louder to the right, the right ear could swivel 
instead. If there's a loud sound in general, both ears could swivel back 
and flattened.

Also, any thoughts on the arduino ( www.arduino.cc )?

Hello Bob,

I've seen what you describe already, animitronics that are pre-programmed. Ears that move towards sounds, tails that wag by themselves, or when you walk, eyes that bink and move... it's been done... but couldn't tell you who did them - maybe someone else can on this list.

I had a friend help me make a duct tape dummy head. It has been
discussed a few times in the fursuit LJ community. There are some
How-To's out there, but I'll go over how mine was made.
Having someone help you is a must. Beyond the dangers of suffocation,
doing such work on your own head would be close to impossible.
I started with a balaclava on my head, my hair completely tucked
underneath it. Then, my friend wrapped my head in cellophane, leaving
my nostrils uncovered so I could breath. Once my head was wrapped and
the cellophane was sticking to itself, he begin placing strips of duct
tape on the cellophane, none on the balaclava. To give the duct tape
head some structure, he started with a band of duct tape around my
crown, like a sweat band. Then a chin strap and pieces across the top
of my head. The pieces don't have to be terribly long, so they are
easier to shape to the contours of your head. Again, the bridge of
your nose can be covered but leave your nostrils uncovered. Once there
was a solid layer of duct tape around my head, he took a pair of cheap
child's safety scissors and cut the cellophane and duct tape. He
started from the back of my neck to slightly below the top of my head.
This allowed the duct tape and cellophane to be removed with out
damaging the balaclava. Don't worry about the cellophane, it can stay
attached to the duck tape head. Take off the balaclava, tape the cut
seam together, stuff the head with polyphil, then tape up the neck
hole.

I hope this helps,

-Tsuyoto

I have worked only with balaclava heads so far and I would actually cut inch thick slabs of foam and duck tape it around the foam heads till I got a lil bit over the measurements of my head (Warning: do not compress the foam down, the foam will tend to try to expand and lift the duct tape up) Cuz when working with the balaclava has you fur it it will shape the head and reduce the stretch in the material which is why the zipper feature is very important otherwise you can't put it over your head...I have also used thick ace bandages for small alterations in size and duct tape over cuz the glue sometimes goes through depending on what fabric the balaclava is made of.

Here's how I made a life cast of my head. Using duct tape may not be as rigid as you like. Go to a hobby/craft store and ask for plaster gauze. This is wonderful stuff. You cut it into strips, dip in water, then cover the desired surface. This stuff will harden in about 15 minutes giving you a rigid mold. If you put this on your head and you have hair, be sure to use a plastic bag fitting tightly so as to retain as much of your nature shape. For your face, use vaseline on eyebrows and such....clean shaven works best for the rest. Only make a mold of half your head (side to side) at a time, or you will have a heck of a time cutting it off. Use the gauze at the end to join the two halves together. For me, I had two part polyeurothane expanding foam. I filled the mold with this, let it set then peeled the gauze off. Now I had a life cast of my head that I could pin to. If you go this route, don't use 'Great Stuff' foam. This requires porosity to allow the solvents to evaporate from the foam. The plaster gauze does not breathe. If you use the balaclava on your head for all of this, it may add thickness making the mold bigger. 
Keep in mind, the gauze will stick to hair (voice of experience) so cover or coat it. This is a little more work than the tape, but the result is a more sturdy form. 
Good luck. I'm about ready to take a stab at making a balaclava head, but my problem is: How can I make the 20.5" wigstand head match the 22" of my own head so this can turn out to fit me more than turn out to be a complete waste? Thanks for the help,     ~Shadow-Da-Wolf

Wrap the wig stand head with polyester batting until you get the volume you need. Then cover that with a plastic shopping bag and tape it down to conform.

I'm about ready to take a stab at making a balaclava head, but my problem is: How can I make the 20.5" wigstand head match the 22" of my own head so this can turn out to fit me more than turn out to be a complete waste?
 
Thanks for the help,

> where could I find the polyester batting at?

Most crafts and fabrics stores will have them. It's the stuffing used in 
quilts. So wherever you're getting your fur from.

In short, use the duct tape to rough out a shape, use the styrofoam head 
to give it a way to mount and solidity, and stuff with padding or 
batting to fill in the difference.
