Nothing to say, other than the fact I still have this mailbox open.

Oh, in some other news,
I modified the head to use 1-inch closed cell neoprene pads as spacers to
position everything in the right place. I also reworked the air deflectors
so that the muzzlefan blows air in all the right places without drying out
my eyes.

I converted the fursuit fan system to Lithium Ion batteries, went from a 5
V system to a 12 V system, added two additional top-mounted 30mm fans to
the costume, and the lithium ion pack that weighs no more than the
original AA pack will now run a full eight hours before needing a
recharge. The whole battery system cost me less than $50. So :shrug: I
hope that's news! I love the new modification as the head is now super
comfortable , much lighter without the extra ice pack on top, and fits
perfectly, with excellent jaw & mouth synchronization.

So there. Now I need some events to attend as it's been since early
February since I've been out and really, I do have the itch for some
fursuiting.  ...and No, FCN is not an option - too many schedule
conflicts.

@Tycho:  Glad to hear you're making improvements to an already awesome 
suit.  I'm thinking about improvements my suit right now, as the last 
time I used it was at the seasonal "When Furballs Strike" meet up in 
Seattle.  I had a blast, but I had problems with heat expulsion and 
sweat getting in my eyes ><.  Tycho, did your suit come with built in 
cooling systems or were those all additions you made?  If they were 
additions, would be lovely to know how to go about adding fans without 
ruining the head :3

Holy smokes is that three fans total now?

You mentioned an ice pack -I'm curious if that was something built in or a mod as well =p

Scape is still chugging along with his old 80mm muzzle fan (takes up the whole muzzle lol) and dual 9v rechargeables (WallyWolf's Schematic) but they only get about two hours each a total of 4 -and I think they may be getting old as I've had them quit on me I swear after just an hour =p  All of a sudden it's like... is it hot in here or is it just me!? hahaha

Do you have a cool vest or anything as well?

Balaclavas are easy to make on your own with a bit of spandex: There are 
patterns out there that can be found with a quick google search.

I did these awhile back just for shittles & giggles, but I thought it would
be nice to share it with everyone who might be new, or just need pointers.

...no, despite the subject line, no members of felis tigris were harmed
in the making of this message. =^_^=

If you've seen me around, you have probably seen me in this costume, or
something like it:

http://chez-vrolet.net/~dennisthetiger/costume/tiger21/0669a.jpg

Recently, I discovered a website called Fabric On Demand: 

http://fabricondemand.com

...which will print this sort of thing onto a poly-spandex blend.  (It
is, for those who use them, approximately the same blend ratio that
spandexwear.com uses.)  Another costumer out there used this service to
build a Spidey suit, of which some of the pictures are found here:

http://www.therpf.com/f24/spider-man-costume-170089/index3.html

My question is this for the artistic types
among this list: how easy would it be to basically "explode" a tiger
stripe pattern onto this?  Any thoughts?

I can't say i have any actual experience with this, but it looks like it
shouldn't be too hard if you already got the skills to make flat pieces of
cloth fit a 3dimentional body and also know your way around a 3d modeling
program. You would have to replicate the intended body in 3d, then match
the UV map to your cloth patterns and then apply the texture the way you
want to. Though i guess parts away from the edges of the template might
come out distorted if you're not careful.
