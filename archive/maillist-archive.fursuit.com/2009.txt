Subject: FL: Club Animals NYC Jan.17 Meeting UPDATED Open Invitation
Message-ID: <8CB3E6D2F7D421C-1644-3F2@webmail-db02.sysops.aol.com>

Note NEW location, the previously announced place recently closed.

"Club Animals is a secret society of mascots. Donning mascot costumes, 
our group of lovable, cuddly animal characters hit the town for once 
(instead of them hitting us). Why do we do this? Because we love the 
brief moments of joy we bring to random strangers who are lucky enough 
to encounter us all together, wearing our animal costumes, and well, 
that's about all there is to it. We consider it to be our old school 
New York good arty deed for the day, as a gift to the city we love and 
its inhabitants. Think SantaCon without the Santas. Created by Nate 
Hill (Chinatown Garbage Tour) and Ryder Ripps, tonight Club Animals 
hosts a meeting for newcomers. Mascot costume not necessary to attend, 
but we're definitely curious to meet your alter ego animal. Are you a 
Cat? A Turtle? A Flying Wombat?

Activities at our meeting will include an informative mini-lecture with 
the current NYU mascot, the Bobcat discussing the duties and details 
that job entails, followed by a Q & A with Bobcat. Veteran Club Animals 
members Fishy will discuss the rare intermingling of art and mascots in 
New York, Dog will entertain us with a choreographed jig, and Bunny has 
free cookies for us to munch on. And to top it all off, the meeting is 
being held in a bar, so we intend to drink like animals! Do join in the 
free fun."

Hi all

Are there any Solicitor Furs living in the UK? Preferably in the South of England? I know of one who lives in London, but she's out of the country until next month.

I need a witness signature for a Statutory Declaration of name change, and I'd like to have a fellow fur do it so I don't have to endure strange looks and awkward questions from someone who doesn't understand this way of life.

Any help would be most appreciated.

Hedgie

Hello,

Sorry if I didn't post or didn't ask well, I'm French and this is my first
reply to this mailing-list. You are changing your name to a furry-sounding
name, that's it? I just want to know (in France, we can't do that; and I
also wonder what name you choose).

Bye.

I cant help but be curious to what you want your new name to be. And I agree with others no matter what when ever you show an ID or submit something, you probably would get strange looks.. I cant imagine what it be like to get stopped by a police officer and tell him my fur name..

In answer to previous questions, with the amount of Polish people living in this country with their 'ski' names everywhere, I don't care if people give me odd looks. 

If I have to see another Polski Delicatesi again, I'll scream loudly! Polish shops are EVERYWHERE in my city!!!

Oh, and my name will be Hedge Hog, for those who wish to know :)

And a few random replies for good measure:

Dimitri Torterat: You can't change your name in France? Bummer!
Camerapup: True, but my current name has a lot of bad memories attached to it, from school and such. I want to rid myself of that, and be who I truely am. I have the right to THAT at least!
Mezzobean: Amen to that!!
F J Cougar: Awesome! You work in IT, right?
Kit Kat: If I ever get stopped by a Police Officer, I'll be asking HIM why!! (I don't drive or break the law, I'm a good boy!)

that dosn't answer my question.

Solicitor is like some one who sells thing.
in the states (i'm not sure if it's slang anywhere else) it's also known as
meaning "prostitute" as well as mail currier and corporate selling venues

so... prostitute furry? mail currier furry? corporate seller furry? vender
furry? what?

I guess you'd use the term Lawyer, Attorney at Law, Justice of the Peace etc. Someone who deals with legal and civil procedures. Divorces, Accident claims, etc.

Hope that clears things up.

Which does rather beg the question of why the original post asking for a
sympathetic solicitor in the South of England was posted to an
international forum about fursuiting.

alright, so me and a non furry buddy of mine are planning on making 2
fursuits where the paterns match when they stand together.  I was wondering
if anybody had some good suggestions for how to make this look spectacular
for a first go at fursuit building.

I understand the basics, foam carving, measuring, sewing, ect ect, but
things like how to make a pattern that's 3d (wraps around the model) match
another pattern that is also 3d? Cheep materal distributors, and such would
also be appreciated.  i'm thinking the suits will be both made with farily
short fur, and maybe a baklava craeation.  so yeah, and stuffs :)

thx for the help,
the fuzzyroo

the easy way is a few rolls of duct tape and make a duct tape dummy.use a cheap pair of clothing that thin and have your buddy tape you up.when done right you have a dummy you can mold fur or streach fabric on and it fit you.

You should do like a yin yang thing where both of you are half colored. Like down that?middle. That'd?be pretty easy with a pattern like #8953 from McCall's.?

Dah Parade in Southern California coming up in just one week on Sunday
the 18th and you're all invited to watch, help, or if you have a fursuit,
participate with us in Old Downtown Pasadena!  Yes, I know, it's only
five days before Further Confusion, BUT if you're gonna be in Southern
California anyway and want to have some pre con fun then please join us!

Here's how to participate: 1) simply e-mail me (NOT this list) at
dlely at juno.com telling me you'll be there.  I will reply with
confirmation giving you more details.  2) Check out the Parade's official
web site at http://www.pasadenadoodahparade.info/ for further information
and maps.  Then on Sunday the 18th of January 2009: 3) meet all of us
furry participants in Memorial Park (150 North Raymond Avenue, Pasadena
CA 91103) before 10:30 AM.  4) Pay your $10.00 per person entry fee to
the organizers (The Light Bringer Project - a nonprofit arts
organization).  5) Wait in the park and have some fun . . . then jump in
the Parade at 11:30 AM and have more fun!

But wait there's more!  Before the parade there is an "all-you-can-eat"
pancake breakfast at the Pasadena Senior Center located right in Memorial
Park and then after the parade everyfur usually regroups for a chow-down
at a popular Pasadena watering hole!

If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me.  Hope to see you all
there!

1.  Hotel News

Due to economic factors beyond our our control, the Doubletree Hotel has
implemented some changes in the Exec Level amenities. Instead of a continental
breakfast served in the Exec Level Lounge, guests staying on the Exec level
will receive a coupon for an equivalent breakfast in Sprigs (the Coffee
Garden). The evening reception will no longer have alcohol and hot appetizers
but will continue to have snacks and beverages during that time.

All other Exec Level amenities remain unchanged. Further Confusion apologizes
for the lateness of this change coming to our knowledge but it is a recent
cost cutting measure implemented by the Doubletree across the board. Economic
downturns affect everyone, I suppose. If you are a guest on the Exec Level,
you should be contacted directly by the Hotel on this matter as well and you
should feel free to register any complaints with them directly.


2.  Bag Stuffing Party!

On the evening of Wednesday, January 21st at 7:00pm, in the San Simeon room at
the Doubletree Hotel, we will be stuffing the goodie bags for FC2009. If you
have something that you want to have put in our bags, please bring them to
this room. We can accept flyers for other cons, ads for webpages, or any other
flyers. Please note that the material must nothing above a PG rating, and
whatever it is you want to put into the bags, you need 3,000 of them, as we
will be stuffing 3,000 bags.


3.  Titanium Tea

It is a time to come together and enjoy one another's company over tea. The
Titanium Tea will be held in the con suite at the Doubletree hotel. Some
snacks will be provided, but feel free to bring food to share. The event will
take place on Friday, January 23rd from 2:00pm - 4:00pm. Be sure to look for
the notice in your convention book or bulletin board near Registration. A
variety of teas (and tisanes) will be provided, but feel free to bring your
favorite to share with others. It would be of great help in reducing cup waste
if you bring your own mug.

Here is what will be available:

Rooibos
Earl Grey
Gunpowder Tea
Chai
White Tea

Also, there will be a signature tea made for the Titanium Tea @ FC 2009. Be
there to sample it!

Any questions, feel free to contact tunduzi(at)gmail(dot)com
See you at the Titanium Tea.

Howdy there!
    Going to be at FC?  Got a fursuit?  Have a mysterious desire to engage 
in  mildly competitive pseudo-sports in front of a crowd of cheering 
onlookers?  Well, keep reading!
    Further Confusion 2009 is almost upon us, looming ominously in the 
future like a giant angry loom.  That means that it's time once again for 
that most celebrated celebration of fursuited athletics, the legendary 
Critterlympics!  Yes, for our eighth spectacular year, wacky characters from 
around the world will converge upon San Jose to determine who will have the 
right to stand tall among their peers and proclaim themselves the Best of 
the Reasonably Good.
    Do you want to be one of the Lucky Few?  Of course you do!  Who doesn't? 
  Evil people, that's who -- soulless black-hearted devils whose very 
footsteps taint the ground upon which they walk.  All you need is a fursuit 
and the Will To Succeed, and the will part is easy to fake.  Oh, you also 
need to sign up.  Sign-ups will be taking place at noon on Saturday at the 
Info Desk, which you'll find near Registration.  The playing field can only 
hold so much athletic awesomeness, so get there early before all the spaces 
are taken!  To be fair, we do insist that you be there in person to sign up. 
  No fair sending someone to sign up all your friends.
    The Games themselves will be taking place on Sunday at 1 p.m. in the 
Convention Entrance.  That's the second hotel entrance, down by the Info 
Desk where you signed up.  Make sure you get there about 15 minutes early so 
you'll have plenty of time to hook up with your teammates and get all warmed 
up and ready to kick tail.  We'll have tents set up for breaks, with water 
and chairs for your convenience.  Yup, we're pretty great.
    In addition to the fursuiters, we also need plain old-fashioned people 
to help out with the proceedings.  What's a team without a team captain, 
after all?  Nothing but a headless monstrosity flailing and flopping along 
the beach, frightening the children, that's what.  Is that what you want FC 
to be known for?  Out-of-control decapitated beach monsters?  Of course not! 
  What can you do to stop this awful fate from befalling our beloved 
convention?  Volunteer, that's what!
    Yes, it's true!  The Critterlympics needs Team Captains, and you're just 
the sort of stalwart buckaroos we can use!  All you have to do is make 
yourself known to Penh, Master of All Things Critterlympic, either via 
e-mail or during the sign-ups on Saturday (noon at the Info Desk) and you 
too can take a hand in guiding destiny.  On the day of the Games (Sunday, 
1pm!), you'll get to take command of a team and make sure they're more or 
less where they need to be when they need to be there.  You'll be their role 
model and parental figure, not to mention the Angry Fist of Doom when they 
get out of line.  Can you really afford to let an opportunity like this pass 
you by?  Of course not!  So, let's sum up.

        Sign-Ups: Saturday, noon, at the Info Desk
  Critterlympics: Sunday, 1 pm, at the Convention Entrance
   Team Captains: Needed

I have been snicking in to the Critterlympics now for my sixth year.
Some one should watch that back door! Well, you know that I will be
there, you might as well accept it now! So, since you know that I will
be there and that I will be up to my old tric... I mean there helping
to entertain the crowd. How about just give in and make me the team
leader of the team known as the Oddballs?

Oh, and as team leader I need a Nerf bat of my own!

It's been so long since I posted ... so here is my little double whammy.

I finally finished a new suit after 3 years of stagnation.  His name is
Nougat and pix can be found here:

www.supercoon.com/Nougat

Nougat will be at FurCon along with a brand new batch of PAFCON shirts
from the infamous furry CSI episode.

This brand new version contains a new font and date style.  Requests from
overseas furs spawned the change.

http://www.ringtailstudios.com/PAFCon/PAFCON09.jpg

I will have what remains at FurCon.  You can touch base with me at the
fursuit round table on Friday if you are there.

If you want to reserve a shirt or have one shipped please email me off
list.  chairoraccoon AT gmail DOT com.

Shirts are $20 in person (while quantities last) or $21 via PayPal for a
hold.

Chirr, hope to see many of you at FC!

Message-ID: <OMEIJPJAFKIANLCOEJOIIEMMHKAA.marcwolf@marcwolf.org>


Hi all

I have started playing around with some silicone rubber and have really
enjoyed working with it as a medium. It is certainly much more resiliant
than latex.

However I have a part of a project that I am trying to work out how to do.
I have some fur fabric that is used in my costume however the fabric with
its glue backing is fairly heavy

I am looking for a technique where I can carefully cut the fur off the
backing and glue it onto the silicone rubber but still keep the look and
feel of the orginal fabric - except of course it will be a mot more flexible
and stretchy

If anyone can give me some advice I would be most grateful

Take Care

Marc

Hello Marc!
  Silicone is a very difficult item to work with given that it tends to
repel everything. If you were mixing and appling your own silicon,  just
apply the silicon to the backing of the fur and force it into the
fibers, then quickly apply and clamp down the siliconed fur onto the
item before the silicone cures. Otherwise, you may want to experiment
with the following glues: Marine Goop, Gorilla Glue, Barges.

Good Luck!

Somehow I never saw the original message :)

One warning if you're setting the fur fibers into the silicone and 
cutting the backing off (to make furry silicone) -- the fibers can be 
pulled out of the silicone with little effort.

Maybe somebody on the list has a technique to get around this?

Skin-tight is a silicoine adhesive that will stick hair to silicone....it's made by Smoothon. Not sure if I get your meaning though.

Thanks for all of your input..

Ysengrin  - Thanks for the info re fur stability.  I have seen a technique
called  Hair Punching in special effects where the fur fibres are folded in
half and set in with silicone.  But from your comments what you describe is
what I am trying to do.

Stego - Silicon is a tricky substance to work with. Esp when moving from
Latex. With Latex you can apply coat after coat leaving each coat to cure.
With Silicon it is the opposite unless you have something to bond new
silicone to old..  See next part!!

Joe Markle - I know of Skin-Tight, and I have some  Silicone adhesive from
Smoothon that I use when applying multiple layers to somethings.  I often
make a clay former and paint on the silicone rather than try and make
negative to pour into.
I would love to get some NFS fabric however I am in Australia and the
difficulties in communicating, and shipping would be too great - esp when I
do not need a lot of the fabric.


Again thanks for all of your input..

Dave a.k.a. Marcwolf

  Skin-tight is a silicoine adhesive that will stick hair to
silicone....it's made by Smoothon. Not sure if I get your meaning though.
National fibre Technology makes a 4 way stretch fur that's great for
suits...it's not cheap though! good luck!

Subject: FL: Suit Commission?
Message-ID: <753329.40119.qm@web56605.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Originally, I was highly focused upon having mixedcandy.com make my new suit.
The linked (really awesome job!) sketch was commissioned via one of the pro artists on their site.
I was told MC's quality is worth it!!!
But after some research, i'm open to other suit makers for a better price / shorter finishing time.

the character sketch:
http://www.mr-bunny.com/victoriaRef.jpg

I'm 6'2 & 140 lbs
with my 29" waist, making the costume look sexy & shapely shouldn't be that hard.
the grey in the sketch should be silver fur.
But apparently silver fur is not an easy thing to get.

I have an immediate $300 for deposit/start.
I have no set date / time limit.
Im open to design / detail ideas
and can answer just about every suit design question asked.

any takers?



This is try #2. I HOPE i'm set properly on the list again. Thank you Yappy! :)

'paws' have leather pads on them and I've recently found that some of 
these leather pads have fallen off, revealing the glove underneath.  How

some careful hand sewing with heavy duty thread \

      Unfortuantely I'm in Arizona, the United States. I feel that the

Are the paws actual gloves - or are they attached to the arm of  the fursuit 
itself? I'm thinking in terms of the shipping here. If they are  gloves you 
can email me and I can probably help you out. (I'm near  Boston.) If it's the 
whole suit they're attached to then you  definitely need somebody more local -

Were they originally sewn on or glued on?  If sewn, it might not be an  
easy repair if you aren't used to sewing leather.  If glued, depending  
on the substrate, some Gorilla Glue or Super 77 should do the trick.

How does Gorilla Glue compare to Super 77, Goop (Marine, Plumbers, those 
tubes of thick adhesive), or hot glue?

Ba'ar, do you see or feel any needle holes and/or broken thread in the 
area? This could help in doing the repair job.

   I'd think that Superjay sewed them on. The peoblem is that some of 
the pads are lost and need to be completely replaced and sewn on.

      They're gloves covered by fur.  There's leather on the pads. The 
problem is that some of the pads have fallen off and have to be replaced.

is it a particular color of leather? You might have to make replacement and then attach them the way the others are.

When I read "fillings come out", I was afraid of teeth falling out!
For me, that's a real fear (several of my teeth have chipped, cracked
and even crowns have been undermined by now).

Tony Ringtail's fur/fursuit BBQ featured a pinata high in a tree.
I don't see that among RonOverdrive's videos but this is the closest match:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQmYYwJwvk

I never got any of the photos, but at an anime convention,
my Taz backpack was full of candy.
His mouth is the opening, and the dragon dancers flung him around
so wildly that the candy flew around the room!

In the "something weird" department, while browsing back issues of the "Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners Journal", I came across an article on End-Bac II.  Apparently, the stuff will give a positive result on tests for gunpowder residue due to nitrates contained in the spray.

Now, I don't think that its likely that you're going to be hauled into the station whilst in fursuit to be questioned about a crime, and they're gonna test yer furry paws to see if you're their shooter, but as scanners at airports become more sophisticated, there would seem to be the possibilities for false positives on chemical scans on one's fursuit containers.

Just a thought.

along this lines with packing fursuits to travel, i got a buddy who works
for TSA.  He's told me that apparently a compound used in most home-made
explosives (or at least the ones that they check for at airports) are found
in nearly all hand and body lotions, as well as other patrolium based
products.

sooo, when packing, pack your skin care sepereatly :P and make sure to wash
your hands before closing the lid XD (or you might have your fursuit flagged
as a bomb and need to be checked :P )

Also if you don't mind, you can pay a weekly rental to a motel that will put people up for weeks like that. The rates are somewhat reasonable, but if the job is good enough then that's something you can get started with too.

Hi all

I know that there are plenty of tutorials on building a Duct Tape Dummy (DTD), but are there any that focus on actually USING it to build a suit? I understand that this might not be the case, since it could be considered "Breaking the Fursuiter code" to reveal techniques that professionals use, but I'd really like some help on it, since I'm planning to build a new suit for FC 2010.

Thanks,

There is no such thing as a fursuiters code. You use the Duct Tape Dummy to
make your pattern and to size the fursuit making sure that it will fit.

The 'fursuiter code'? WTF is that?

Does this hobby need any more drama than it already has?

Sometimes I'm ashamed to be a part of it.

What Donkey said is pretty much right. But there are some who absolutely 
refuse to reveal how they do some things.

Making your pattern will take a bit of time. What I did was cover the 
dummy with plastic wrap and then cover the wrap with duct tape. Cut where 
you want your seams to be, and you've just made a pattern. Transfer it to 
some cheap cloth like muslin, adding a few inches to the sides, torso, 
arms, and legs.

Then put together that pattern with safety pins where the seams should be 
and try it on. It should fit. If not, take it in a little here and there 
til you get the fit you want. Trace out or cut the cloth about an inch 
from the new seam area.

That will be the pattern you'll use to transfer to the fake fur. Make sure 
you mark what section it is.

What other questions do you have? We'll answer them here. Look up draping. 
The FAQ has mention of it, but there's some good sites out there that 
explain draping in better detail.

Quite a few, unfortunately. The previous suit I owned, Blaster, was simply a 
carbon copy of a Simplicity pattern with a fur fabric head with a cycle 
helmet stuffed inside. Obviously, times have changed, and suits look a LOT 
better now than they did in 2003!

Heads are probably the toughest thing to make, and I'm a bit aprehensive 
about using Hot Glue, since when I use it, it either: dries out before I've 
affixed the fur to the foam, soaks through the fur and discolours it, or 
ends up with too much on one area, and not enough on the other!

I'm considering using PVA glue, also known as school glue. It's tough enough 
to stick wood together, so surely it can glue fur fabric to foam?

What kind of foam are you using? If you are using upholsterer's 
foam(like I do), you'll run into some problems. Any liquid glue (white 
glue, school glue, tacky stuff...) will soak into the foam, meaning that 
you either saturate the foam with glue, altering it's structure or you 
end up with the fur falling off. Hot glue also has problems. It can melt 
the foam. And DAP WoodWeld (which I used on my last head) dissolved the 
foam, making it tricky to use.

I'm going to try Super77 
(http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M-Super-77/Super77/) for 
my next project. Given that it's an aerosol, it'll probably melt the 
foam as well, but the application will be easier to control. WoodWeld 
pooled and created spots of resin that dried to a crusty plastic-like layer.

Good luck. And let us know what worked for you.

*de-lurks*

Stego used a DTD as a foundation for his fursuit B*tch.  It worked well, 
but it didn't breathe at all - he literally had to pour the sweat out of 
the feet after wearing the suit for a while (ew).  As for gluing foam, I 
used 3M's Hi-Strength 90 on a fursuit I made in 1998 (my fursona Chythar) 
and the head is still quite intact after 10 years.  The foam is still good 
as well, since I sweat into a baklava instead of the foam.  The foam will 
rip before the glued seams come apart, yet it's a flexible bond.  I also 
used HS90 to glue the fur down, and it's still down.  I have used hot glue 
on corners of the fur & foam where it's difficult to spray in, but I do use 
it sparingly.  Too much hot glue will seep through the fur backing and glue 
the fur itself down.

I do use hot glue to hold the seams open on the bodysuit, and it works very 
well.  Just don't use too much as I mentioned above.

I have used 3M 77 glue on all of my fursuits with 3Ms super strength
adhesive on the edges. I have yet had a problem of it coming defured. But I
have had one problem with it if you are not very careful you will have glue
seep through the fur and you will have your fur matted down. I tried a 3M 77
knock off on my last head and it was a disaster. There is something else
that I am going to try, 3M 74, on my next head, that is if I can get my
hooves on some.

Greetings,

We would like to take the time to thank all of you that had attending
Further Confusion 2009 as well as the many staff members that made it
happen. This up and coming year marks a huge change for Further Confusion,
as the convention is moving hotels to the Fairmont in San Jose, CA. We are
pleased to announce that hotel reservations will be opened at 5:00pm
(Pacific) Friday March 13th. Room rates are $129 for regular rooms and
$229 for suites.

The hotel reservation site will be:

<https://resweb.passkey.com/go/furtherconfusion>

You may also call the Fairmont at 1-800-257-7544 and ask for the FURCON or
Further Confusion room rate.

IMPORTANT CHANGE, PLEASE NOTE! 

We have also instituted a change for hotel rooms being reserved at the
Fairmont. Once you make a hotel reservation, you will be required to pay
for one room night beginning November 1st, 2009. That means, you have
until October 31st, 2009 to cancel your room night without any penalty.
After October 31st, you be charged for one room night.

Please email hotel at furtherconfusion.org with any questions.


Fursuit and Party Floors:

Please fill out the online request form at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2010/hotel_requests>

You will need the hotel confirmation number, your real name and your
email. Once you have the confirmation number, enter it on the website URL
from above and send it to us. We will process your request as they come in
on a first come, first serve basis.

Note that we have a limited amount of party rooms.


FAQ:

We anticipate that most questions that will be asked can be answered by
looking at our Hotel FAQ at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2010/hotel>. If you have a question
that you cannot find the answer for there, please email us at
hotel at furtherconfusion.org.

I agree with the early canceling policy, but I don't agree with having it
that early. I think having it like the 15th of December would be better. If
something happens that prevents the person from going could cancel; who
really knows what might happen almost three months in advance. It also gives
someone that is waiting for a opening plenty of time to get the available
room.

Thank to everyone who sent me links and gave me info on using a DTD. Now that I've gathered enough info on the body, I've started looking at heads. 

I was going to opt for a balaclava method, but then the idea to develop on the Blaster 1 suit head came to me. I plan to use a skateboarders helmet (since they're very round and smooth) as the basis, and have the head 'hang' from the helmet as it were. I'll be using a combination of stuffing foam and plastic reinforcement struts to build the features, instead of carved foam.

As someone mentioned, there is no proper method to build a suit, so, hopefully, since I feel it'll work, it will. I'll provide pictures of it once I start getting a proper design together.

The only "proper" method to build a fursuit (head or otherwise) is the one 
that gives you the results YOU WANT. Any other methods are just different 
ways to do the same thing.  :)

Amen ;)  I went the skateboard helmet route and it's been absolutely  
wonderful!

 Hey Hedge,

 

Good luck with your suit project, indeed it can be a little frustrating sussing out the right method of construction to use.

 

We all have different methods and we are all still learning. If your not happy with it, do it again and you will will only gain knowledge.

Several DTD tutorials suggest using pajamas. I've learned of fursuiters simply obtaining a one-piece footed pajama, or jumpsuit-style pajama suit in the desired size and then reverse-engineer that into a fursuit pattern--without all the duct tape. 
Best of Luck!

What kind of foam are you using? If you are using upholsterer's foam(like I
do), you'll run into some problems. Any liquid glue (white glue, school
glue, tacky stuff...) will soak into the foam, meaning that you either saturate
the foam with glue, altering it's structure or you end up with the fur
falling off. Hot glue also has problems. It can melt the foam. And DAP WoodWeld
(which I used on my last head) dissolved the foam, making it tricky to use.

I'm going to try Super77
(http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M-Super-77/Super77/) for my next
project. Given that it's an aerosol, it'll probably melt the foam as
well, but the application will be easier to control. WoodWeld pooled and created
spots of resin that dried to a crusty plastic-like layer.

Good luck. And let us know what worked for you.

I used an old bicycling helmet in one of my character heads. A helmet provides a sturdy foundation for any antlers, horns, antennae, etc.

Amen ;)  I went the skateboard helmet route and it's been absolutely
wonderful!

 G'day all,

 

Would anyone have about 2 or 3 yards of a minimum half inch pile, bright yellow (AH fibre- the good stuff) as I'm pretty much stumped on where to go for such a small amount. I dont need heaps, so I just thought I asked before I started ringing OS.

 

Thanks heaps,

Hi friends!

Swift Fox from Pittsburgh here to share some news of importance to our little part of the fandom.  Over the last handful of years, Morphicon, held in Columbus OH, has been down-played as not being a "fursuit friendly" convention.  As the new programming director for 2009, I've asked Lascivus Lutra to help me as Fursuiting Track head with the instructions to produce a list of panels that will change that perception in the fandom.

I think he's succeeded in that task and I'm here to share a little of what the fursuiting community can expect when they register to attend our event the weekend of May 15-17, 2009.  Morphicon will have two dedicated fursuit friendly dances, two sets of fursuit games, a judged Menagerie with focus on performance, professional photo sessions, a parade adn photo shoot, and a host of "How to" lectures. 

Under my watch, I've tried to steer the programming for this convention back towards center; but the only true litmus of our success and failure is shown by your support of the convention and what it has to offer.  I encourage you to give this small, social convention in central Ohio a second try.  I am confident that Morphicon will not live up to it's reputation this year.

Thank you for your time,

Swift Fox (Ashes the Dalmatian)

Subject: FL: How do I make it snarl?
Message-ID: <775945.57404.qm@web63106.mail.re1.yahoo.com>


I'm looking to make my fursuit snarl. I thought about rigging up some small tubing in the muzzle and having fishing line go through that's attached to teh fur lips, and hopefully the when the line is pulled it would create a snarling effect. 
?
But I think there is a better way to get the snarling effect right? Can anybody help me out? I don't know anything about animatronics or circutry but if someone could break that down for me that'd be awesome. SO any ideas on how to make a snarl?
?
?
Sincerely,
ZoharSkarth

The way I have seen it done, other than with servos - is with cables,
tubing - and springs. Fishing line can be used rather than the cable,
but you're best to get the really thick kind (Almost like that for weed
eaters).

The cable threaded through the tube so it will not bind, and you can
have a fulcrum to pull against. You attach the tubing to the skull of
the head for support. A spring is attached inside the head to provide
the restoring forces needed to pull things (like the fur) back into place.

The cable and tube is then attached outside the head to a plunger
mechanism. When someone pulls on (or a solenoid pulls on) the cable, the
movement is transferred to other mechanisms (stiff rod or other cables)
and deforms the facial parts (e.g. lips).

When the plunger is released, the interior springs at the opposite end
(inside the head/near the lips) of the cable - pulls back the cable and
the fur back to where it was before. Getting the tension and the right
springs is the tricky part. Too strong a spring, and it doesn't move
right. Too weak a spring, and it never returns to it's original shape.

In short, you set the fur to be normal, then when you pull on the cable
(against the tubing) to make it snarl. And when you release the plunger,
(or tension in the cable) the spring pulls the cable and the fur back
into (a pre-snarl) shape.

You can see how some of this is built with servos and other animatronics
over at:

And here is an example of a hand operated plunger

It requires a lot of patience, but it can be done.

Message-ID: <d23d76ca0904291332q63feaa12t82ff6f593db510c2@mail.gmail.com>

I have a question about renaming fursuits. I am wondering what other furs
think of fursuits being renamed. If I do it or not it will have little to
nothing to do with the responses that I get. Feel free to say what you
think. If you feel like answering is spamming the list feel free to send
your response to me privately. I would really like to know what others think
on this subject.

I am seriously thinking of naming a bran new fursuit after one of my pets,
that it will end up looking like, also he will not be around for to much
longer because he is quite old. I am doing it more to honer his memory than
because it will look like him. Now as for the fursuit that I am thinking of
renaming, l an thinking of renaming Donkey, my donkey fursuit. I am playing
with the idea of renaming him to King after my RL donkey. Now King is still
young and donkeys life span is very long compared to horses. So he should be
with me for a very long time. So I am not concerned about honoring his
memory. But since I am liking the idea of having fursuits matching my pets,
I am tossing around the idea if renaming Donkey to King.

Ultimately the decision is yours to make, they are your suits after all.
You should take into consideration how well known your suits are under their
current names, it could be confusing for people who have seen your suits at
various times over the last several years.

Personally, I'd be more inclined to build new suits with the names (and
personalities) than to rename any of my current suits.

That is definitely a problem that one might have to be overcame. I am not
that sure that in my case that would be that big of a problem. I am
normality addressed as Donkey no matter what fursuit I am wearing. I find
that annoying but I have learned to deal with it. Maybe my big mistake was
naming a fursuit after my self in the first place. Well that was long ago
and the damage was done.

There doesn't seem to be a set formula to naming one's fursuit. Some use a variation of an existing character from literature, comics, cartoons, or video games. Some use the name of their character animal from other languages. Yet others simply add the name of thier favorite sport or pastime to the name of thier animal type like "basehit bobcat" or "duffer hound." I'm not sure what the Spanish word for donkey is, but Burro Rey might be a name you'd consider. The classic Krazy Kat comic strip made mention of Donkey Oatey, IIRC.

Hi all:

Sorry this topic is not fursuit related. I have a question on T-shirt, I find that the large color printed area on t-shirts sometimes get cracks after a while. Does anyone know how to maintain t-shirt and prevent those cracks? Is there any detail I need to pay attention on when using washer and dryer??


Thank you :3

Turn the shirt inside-out when washing.
Wash on gentle cycle.
Tumble dry with air only (no heat) or lowest possible heat.  If
possible, hang to dry instead.

Wash the shirts inside-out on a gentle cycle and line-dry them.  That
will preserve them as best you can hope for.

Oh, and NEVER use bleach or bleach substitutes, even "color safe" ones.

Hey all,

I'm not sure if this has ever been brought up before, but I just saw this
on the bottom of an airline ticket that I just bought within the past
month.  I've not seen this particular disclaimer before, and thought it
was worth mentioning.

"On domestic flights, Continental's maximum liability limit for checked
baggage is $3000 USD per passenger and Continental excludes liability for
all unchecked baggage. On international flights governed by the Warsaw
Convention (including the domestic portions of the trip), maximum
liability for checked baggage is approximately $640 USD per bag, and $400
USD per passenger for unchecked baggage. On international flights governed
by the Montreal Convention (including domestic portions of the trip)
maximum liability for baggage is 1,000 SDRs per passenger for checked and
unchecked baggage. You can declare excess valuation on certain baggage at
the airport, additional fees will apply. Continental excludes liability
for fragile, valuable or perishable items carried in all baggage including
jewelry, computers, cash, camera equipment and similar valuables. If any
of these items are lost, damaged or delayed, you will not be entitled to
any reimbursement. "

Now, I will say that I've not had a problem with flying with fursuits
before.  The one time that a bag didn't make my flight due to a
connection. it was returned to me at my office the very next day.  While I
find the listing disconcerting, it does make me want to call the airline
and ask about declaring excess valuation on bags that may have a fursuit
in them.  Has anyone seen this type of language or disclaimer on the
confirmations of airline tickets on any other carrier?

Well, not completely.  I called Continental to ask about the policy and
got some more information.  They will allow you to declare a value of up
to $5000 US in total for your checked bags on domestic flights. 
(International are different completely.)  They still cover up to the
$3000,  when you declare the contents.  You need to pay for the difference
as an extra on your ticket.  The cost with Continental is $1 per $100 of
value over the $3000 mark.  So you'd pay up to an extra $20 (each way) if
declaring up to $5000.  In order to decalre, you need to be able to remove
the contents when checking the bag to show that the item is actually in
the bag.

Should you need to file a claim, you'd need to be able to provide a
photograph of the lost item, which should match the description of what
you declared.  You'd also need a verifiable statement from whoever built
the costume stating what it's replacement cost would be.  They would need
to verify the cost against that of other costumes that were built by the
same producer.

Some items are automtically excluded from this policy.  Chief among these
are electronics and jewelry.  These will never be covered from loss of
checked luggage (and so they should NEVER EVER EVER be checked).

It was interesting because the person who fielded my call had difficulty
in locating this information.  It's apparently not something many people
have looked into.

So that's Continental's policy in a nutshell.  Has anyone else checked
into the policies of other airline carriers?

It sounds like they want you to jumb through a lot of hoops.  I wonder if anyone has ever successfully filed a claim and got compensated for lost luggage.

Wonder what the response is if you're sitting in your seat aboard the
plane and then notice someone dancing around the tarmac while wearing
YOUR fursuit.

..I can't remember if it was on this list where I read about this
happening.  But I am curious about whatever became of it.  Not to
mention other performers that have had their costume luggage
"misplaced".

I believed it happen in Australia when a Camel suit that was used for
professional advertising purposed was grabbed by an employee on the tarmac
and the head worn.
I think the employee was sacked very shortly afterwards because the owner of
the suit  was very annoy (Understandably)

I would be WTF and demand that the worker be arrested for grand theft. I
would also be all over the papers bringing up the question of what else
employees have stolen out of peoples luggage.

If I was in charge of the airport I would agree to have the worker arrested.
So other workers would not get ideas in there heads. Also to keep the
lawsuits from coming out of the wood work.

Checked Baggage Fees

Many airlines now charge fees for checked baggage. These fees are not
included in your trip cost, and are paid separately to the carrier.

Checked baggage policies vary by airline, destination, frequent flyer
status, booking class, bag size and weight. Fees may apply if you plan to
check a bag or if you plan to carry sports equipment or an odd-shaped item
or your bag exceeds airline weight limits. Baggage policies apply each way
for select flights.

Note: Baggage policies and fees are subject to change by the airlines at any
time. You are advised to verify the policy directly with the airline at the
time of booking for the most complete, up-to-date information.

using makeup or facepaint to give his face and upper body the look of 
different characters.

And, whoa... Nicely done too, and pretty expressive and creative.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/howaboutthat/5207199/James-Kuhn-the-man-who-painted-his-face-every-day-of-the-year-has-finished-the-365-day-project.html

If anyone has difficulty with the long URL, I'll post a shorter one.

Imagine how people, especially kids, would react to someone walking down 
the street looking like a popular character. Oh, the mobs... How popular 
would he be if he turned his face into a puppet character?

I'm about to have a play with blending colours on a husky head which is pretty daunting, considering I've spent heaps of time furring it and don't want to ruin it altogether.

 

I have used 1 inch pile white/ light grey and  on the head and a the muzzle is  white. I would like to add just a touch of greyish blue and black just to give it a little accent with the blue iris's.

 

I have blended the length with scissors and looks pretty good.

 

I'm thinking of thinning down RIT dye or leather dye with what I don't know.

 

 

Also is there the possibility of a liquid (bottle) of scotchguard or something similar you could add to the mix???

 

I have a brand spanking new exhaust fan and spray booth in my studio, so I'm ok running the nasty toxic stuff.

 

 

 

Can anyone offer any suggestions on how to go about it properly.

 

Kind reguards,

Personally, I use the Createx airbrush fabric paints. The wonderful thing about this is, if you don't like the outcome, just brush the fur a lot and the paint will come off. If you're happy with it, just take a hair dryer to it and this will set the paint. Naturally, practice first on a piece of scrap fur. Any fur I have worked with won't take the RIT dyes. If you know of a technique that works, I'd like to hear it. Now, if you only want accents, or 'tips'. I have done this in the past by airbrushing across the top of the hairs (not 'into' the hair) and against the grain. This will lift the hairs and apply the paint only to the tips. You may want to use a comb or brush to assist you with the lifting action. If you spray with the grain, it may turn out too dark and the paint may go too deep. Good Luck.

So here is an odd set of questions...

I know you can set the airbrush using a hair dryer.  But what happens when it comes time to wash the suit?  Just cold water on a gentle cycle or hand washing, would that be okay?  Or will some of the paint flake off no matter what?  If it does flake off and go in to the water, will it create a new dye and possibly dye other areas that you don't want?

Thanks!!!!

Speaking as one with a very airbrushed suit my cheetah Cosmo http://mixedcandymascots.com/gallery/v/useyourowneyes/cosmocheetah/, you will have fading after each wash.

It's unavoidable but you wash it inside out in cold with woolite by hand.  Never had any problems with the color migrating to non airbrushed areas.  I personally then toss it into the washer for a quick spin cycle to get the water out before I air dry it.  The fade is not that bad and I have put him through several washes before I had him touched up and re-airbrushed.

Hope that helps,
Blaez

Hi folks,

I am new to the list and hoping this kind of request is allowed here. I am

My last suit I traded massage for, and I am hoping to be able to do that

I have a room reserved for next Thursday night through Monday for Rocket City Fur Meet (http://www.rcfm.net/). One of my roommates had to cancel because of financial difficulties. The other roommate is uncertain if he'll be able to attend because of a family crisis.

It is now possible that I may end of with no roommates. So, I'm asking again if anybody going to RCFM is looking for a room. I am a fursuiter, non-smoker, minimal drinker, and quiet fur who likes the company of friends and doesn't want to go to RCFM alone.

Contact me if you are looking for one more roommate or are looking for a room.

Message-ID: <60e717ff0905201644q4d00fd2arc37b15b71f088ec4@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all, I recently completed a full fursuit with lots of foam padding for
digitigrade legs, chest and shoulders, and am wondering if there are any
special washing techniques anyone out there uses for this kind of fursuit,
taking into account the foam.  Normally, I would just stick it in the washer
and hang it to drip / air dry, but I am concerned that the foam will take
too long to dry, or may never dry at all, or may develop mould.  The foam
padding is surrounded in places by polyfill, and is not removable...  Any
tips?

I was our foam padded suits in the machine, then hang it in a closet with a dehumidifer running on the warmest possible setting.   I can dry a fully padded suit in about 18 hours.

I believe the procedure for washing a padded fursuit would be similar to washing an Army sleeping bag. Make a small tub of warm soapy water. Then take a mall towel, dip it in the soapy water and wring it out, then use it to wipe about the inside of the suit.?Follow up with a clean dry towel. Ten hang up to dry in front of a fan or in the sun.

Subject: FL: Chick-Fil-A Cow Appreciation Day: Friday, July 10th
Message-ID: <1561238754.5199961243444391184.JavaMail.root@sz0174a.westchester.pa.mail.comcast.net>

Mark your calendars, because the Chick-Fil-A Cow Appreciation Day is coming up in just a little over a month on Friday, July 10th. This is the day when anyone dressing up in a cow costume and going to their favorite Chick-Fil-A restaurant will get a free meal!

If you don't have a cow costume, well, you've got about six weeks to make one. It only took me two weeks to complete mine :-)

For more details, see: www.cowappreciationday.com

FWIW, while CFA features the Holstein cow in its advertising, you don't have to necessarily be dressed as a Holstein cow to get free food.  I know at least one person has gone in previous years in a solid black bull costume and still got a free meal.  However, it is going to have to be a cow or bull of some kind to get a free meal - other creatures aren't going to work.  That said, you could try (at your own risk) to show up in some other costume with a friend who's in a cow costume and at least get to do some public fursuiting.

If anyone in the Atlanta area wants to join me that evening, I'm going to try to get a group together to go to the Perimeter Mall area CFA that's next to the Regal Cinemas around 7 PM that day.  If you're interested, email me off-list and I can send more details once I nail them down.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

I'm looking to build a complete fursuit and cannot seem to locate what I need around here (Columbus, Ohio). I would buy online but am concerned about quality and, especially, colouring. I'm looking to add another fox 'suit to the world and would like input on what brands to buy and what brands to watch out for. Mostly, I am looking for a cinnamon coloured fur but with the variations in cameras and monitors I'm concerned the colour I see online will not be the colour I want. If anyone could direct me to a good source for one or both I would appreciate it. Thanks.

Ask the suppler for a swish of the fur. When you receive it in the snail
mail you will know what your ordering.

Hello fellow furs:
Just a reminder, if your fursuit is a female character, we would very much like to display it in our gallery on FA. Just follow the link and read the journal as to how to submit links to your pics. It's our goal to build the largest collection of furry females, so please send your pics and tell your friends.....and guys, there is a lot of eye candy here.
Thanks all! Hope to hear from you.

Message-ID: <538044.51224.qm@web72204.mail.tp2.yahoo.com>





Hi all:



I am currently modifying a fox fursuit and run into a little problem on the
eyes. I believe there are already plenty of ways and materials of how to make
eyes posted, if anyone knows any of the link to this topic please direct me to
those links :3



So...I was thinking lady's stocking would be perfect for the pupil, but I
didn't realized that the stocking is way too thin and real eyes can be seem
from outside, if I double layer the stocking this won't be a problem but it
will be kind hard to see things. Any suggestions on lady's stocking if you are
using it?



Also I just had an idea to use camera films to make the pupil, I guess if real
eyes get close enough....it shouldn't be too hard to see through? 



Last, if I want to use sun glass lenses, don't know if is there a way (or a
tool can be found at home) to cut the lens to desired size??



Thank you for reading meow :3 

Kofu

I have used the finest (most closely-spaced holes) plastic mesh I can find
(plastic embroidery mesh, available at most craft stores) and painted them
over for the pupil.  The rest of the eyes are cut-out parts of those cheapo
white/blank plastic masks, painted in my eye colour.  Here is the result on
my personal fursuit: http://www.furaffinity.net/view/1935802/  Another
method I have used with success is using plastic screen-door mesh inside of
thin foam strips (Foamies)  On this suit:

Hey Kofu!

Buckram fabric is my favorite for eyes -usually found in the odd  
little small fabric roll shelf near the cutting table at most fabric  
stores -or just ask for it at the counter -i think it's a fabric they  
usually use in making ladies hats or something.
Anyways -for the pupil -simply lightly spray paint both sides of it  
with matte black -tada!

I wish I could still get them, but I used to use plastic eyeglass lens  
blanks from a local surplus store.  I painted the cornea and iris on  
the inside of the lens and looked out the pupil.  It was usually dark  
enough inside the head that the tiny hole wouldn't reveal anything  
inside.

Nowadays, the best substitute I've found are halves of do-it-yourself  
Christmas ornaments from a craft and hobby store.  They're more  
bulbous, so they need to be set deeper into the head and covered with  
more eyelid fabric.

I have used white silk for this. The weave is tight enough to look smooth, fibers are thin enough to offer excellent visibility and I only use a marker (sharpie) to color it. Results are awesome.

speaking of pupils, i'm wondering if i'm the only one crazy enough to
actually use formal optics and apertures to make a light sensitive and
responsive pupil complete with dilation and constriction depending on the
ambient light intensity?

also, am i the only one to use a camera system (X10, CCD, small surveillance
type etc) hooked to those cool LCD glasses you can get and install them
inside the fursuit head so you can have camera clear vision as well as a way
to record your fursuiting from a first person POV?

i'm just curious as to how many others use these highly technical and geeky
solutions for ``eyes,,

If you contact a store that specializes in plastics and resins, chances are they carry sheets of "pop bottle" plastic. This is amazing material. It has a very low melting temperature and can be stretched over a master mold to create whatever shape and size eye you desire. I make my masters from plaster of paris then heat and stretch the plastic. If you find a paint opaque enough, you will be able to see thru it like sunglasses. I buy mine from Industrial Plastics and Paints here in calgary....but I'm sure there are others who carry this. I have scads of this here.....if anyone would like to try a small piece (serious inquiries only), I would be happy to send you a sample of the thick and thin variety to experiment on. Additionally, if you screw up, your piece is not scrap. Just reheat and restretch/reform it....this is amazing stuff!

Hi there,  I would suggest Buckram for the Iris (colored part) and Pupil
(black part)...

I don't know if he is on this list, but I know that BigBadWolf did the  
cameras-and-display thing a few years back.

Hi all:

I am currently modifying a fox fursuit and run into a little problem on
the eyes. I believe there are already plenty of ways and materials of how
to make eyes posted, if anyone knows any of the link to this topic please
direct me to those links :3

So...I was thinking lady's stocking would be perfect for the pupil, but I
didn't realized that the stocking is way too thin and real eyes can be
seem from outside, if I double layer the stocking this won't be a problem
but it will be kind hard to see things. Any suggestions on lady's
stocking if you are using it?

Also I just had an idea to use camera films to make the pupil, I guess if
real eyes get close enough....it shouldn't be too hard to see through? 

Last, if I want to use sun glass lenses, don't know if is there a way (or
a tool can be found at home) to cut the lens to desired size??

Thank you for reading meow :3 
Kofu


I have heard of fursuit makers using women's black stockings for the
pupils and it could work to conceal the performer if the inside of the
head is very dark.  Regardless, I also have used and recommend black
buckram fabric as it is much thicker, stronger, longer lasting, and
harder for light to enter the head.  Ask for it at fabric stores.

As far as using camera film or sunglass lenses, I know some fursuit
makers have used both dark and mirrored sunglass lenses.  There should be
no need to cut the lenses as they can be hidden behind the iris.  One
word of caution about using any solid film, plastic ball, or sunglass
lens - they can fog up and make it hard to see out the fursuit head since
there is no way for the humid air inside the head to escape.  Some folks
have tried using anti fog solution (available at dive shops) on the
inside of the lens, electric fans inside the fursuit head to exhaust out
or blow around humid air, or small holes placed next to each eye allowing
for fresh air to enter the head.

Good luck with the modification of your new fox fursuit.

Try Monterey Mills (http://www.montereymills.com/) furs.  They have a
cinnamon fur under "Cubby Bear"
(http://www.montereymills.com/index.php?id=12) that you might like. 
Also, for a small price they will send you a sample package of all of
their available furs so you can see in advance what you are getting. 
Some fabric stores carry Monterey Mills furs or you can buy direct as
long as you purchase their minimum which I believe is still one roll or
$100.00 worth of fur.

Good luck in bringing your creation to life!

If you don't wanna spend that much, Monterey Mills does have a storefront
site. http://www.usaknit.us.com/ There you can buy almost any fur Monterey
Mills makes in 5 yard lengths (just under 16 bucks a yard for the cinnamon
so about 80 bucks or so before shipping).  I am making a suit for my mate
and he needed a brown fur and it was through http://www.usaknit.us.com/ that
I bought the fur, very awesome quality and price.  Good customer service,
too.
IMO, the link to usaknit needs to be put into the archives, I know the
Monterey Mills link is in there, but it took me a while to find usaknit.

I don't think this has been mentioned, but this just came to mind. You 
know those little things like washers people use to lift something off a 
surface? Use something that's maybe a millimeter or two in height.

What this does is allow air to come in from the sides of the lenses, thus 
avoiding the need for making holes.

I'm not quite big on sunglass lenses since they can make it difficult if 
not impossible for you to navigate dimly-lit areas.

But this leads to another question... You know those eyeglass lenses that 
darken when you're outside? Has anyone used them on suit heads? How well 
do they work?

I've made five suits so far, and I've put fans in all but the first,
and they ventilate extremely well.  That's the first thing I plan and
wire up in the head.  I've tried to ventilate, yes, but I've succeeded
very well.  I don't know why you think it doesn't work.

OK, I went out to buy a large mixing bowl, to make fursuit eyes from. I did
not expect it to take all day!

I went to a wal-mart and three major grocery stores. None had a white
plastic mixing bowl!?! Oh they has ceramic, glass, and steal ones but no
plastic mixing bowls I went into a drug store just because it was right next
to the last major grocery store that I went to. I was not expecting to find
it but I said to my self, "Heck I am here anyways".

Well they had some.

I would say that the wal-mart and the three grocery stores need to be B
slapped for not carrying something that they should and that a drug store
did.

You don't have to use exactly a white mixing bowl, you can use a cheap white plastic trash can, a white plastic bucket, or really anything else plastic and white that fits the bill.

So I'm looking for advice. I was at a friend's party Friday night, and
had a great time there, but sadly my fursuit had a disaster in the
process. Folks were painting/drawing on each other in sharpie and from
some hugging of them without realizing it my suit has been stained. Now
the paws I was planning on replacing soon anyway, my hands sweat so much
the fur has been destroyed for the msot part already, but anyone have
any idea of anyway to get the sharpie out of the chest fur? Here are
pics of what I'm talking about:

*whimpers* My suit is so special to me, it's the number 2 thing in my
world aside from my bf. I have been trying to just go with it, deal with
it, and it's slowly been eating me up inside for letting this happen to
it. So any advice would be good, chances are I'll just have to save and
have the white fur replaced though. =-_-= But if you see me wearing my
hockey jersey in suit in the near future, well you now know why. And I
am not upset at the sharpie artists or sharpie wearers, it was just an
accident, no one knew this would happen.

If it helps, Build-a-Bear workshop sells an inexpensive fur cleaning
solution.  I've used it a couple of times to get out some fairly crappy
stains, but i've never tried it on sharpie.  It is possible that since most
of the staining is on the white that you may be able to use some sort of
bleach type product to clean it, i would not however reccomend bleach as
it'll probly do AWFUL things to the fur.

I'll see if i can come up with a better answer for you, until then i'd try
the Build-a-bear stuff if there's a store near you.  If not you can order on
the web.

Hope this helps.

OH YEH!   I've heard of that.  It works really well.  for those of us not
located around florida, do you know if they sell it in other stores?  I'm
not sure i've seen it here in NC.

Tried washing it?

I've had similar stains before, from various inks.  A thorough hand 
washing with Woolite managed to clean it up surprisingly well.  Might 
take a couple washes to really get it out, but this might come out 
easier than you'd think.  And the sooner you wash it, the better.

Ordinary rubbing alcohol should work on Sharpie stains.

As always, test an inconspicuous spot first.

I used OxiClean on my fox suit when the hula skirt I was wearing had
the green dye on the rope that held it up rub onto the white portions
of my suit.  I didn't discover that happened until about a month after
MFF, where I wore the hula skirt.  It came out pretty nicely after I
let the OxiClean settle into the fur for a few minutes.

Folex to the rescue!!

You can find this at most grocery stores (usually where they sell cleaning
stuff) Safeway DEFINITELY has it.

This seems to get ANYTHING off White fur!  Its not expensive and I suggest
getting some and first, try it on your paws, THEN on your body suit.

I know rubbing alcohol will remove some permanent inks....but I don't know how well this will work on the fur. If you try this, just make sure to do it in small bouts and blot frequently so the ink won't run should the RA break it down. Good luck.

So I'm looking for advice. I was at a friend's party Friday night, and
had a great time there, but sadly my fursuit had a disaster in the
process. Folks were painting/drawing on each other in sharpie and from
some hugging of them without realizing it my suit has been stained. Now
the paws I was planning on replacing soon anyway, my hands sweat so much
the fur has been destroyed for the msot part already, but anyone have
any idea of anyway to get the sharpie out of the chest fur? Here are
pics of what I'm talking about:

world aside from my bf. I have been trying to just go with it, deal with
it, and it's slowly been eating me up inside for letting this happen to
it. So any advice would be good, chances are I'll just have to save and

hockey jersey in suit in the near future, well you now know why. And I
am not upset at the sharpie artists or sharpie wearers, it was just an

Sharpie and its ilk are alcohol based markers. I've had very good results removing sharpie stains with a 50/50 solution of dish washing detergent and rubbing alcohol. 

I also remember trying to "dye" white fur a long time ago with a Sharpie. It didn't do very well and it faded almost completely after a few washes. You might be able to get the stain out with regular washing.

Thank you for everyone's suggestions and support in this matter. I'm
going to try some OxyClean first with the Folex suggestions as a
secondary idea if it doesn't work. *hugs*

Thank you all again.

There is a tour bus company that has zebra painted buses in Frisco Ca. For
shits and giggles I sent them a photo of me in my zebra fursuit. They want
me to come in for an interview for the job in the fursuit. I agreed to come
for the same reason that I sent the first E-mail aka for shits and giggles.

Hi hi:

I want to thank everyone for providing help and suggestions here, I was busy and being rude to not say anything (because preparing for AC). So, thank you guys very much! I would like to share the result with you here with links to pictures.

I end up taking previous suit owner's eye material and end up paint it over with black sharpie, and glue it on thin craft foam sheet. So I still don't know what kind material I was using, it feels like window screen made out of fabric (not metal material), so far it works great.
http://gallery.timduru.org/v/Furry/Kofu/P1011613.jpg.html

Even though I still went to store and asked for buckram since lots of people suggested it. I found that buckram they had in store was really high dense and very hard to see through, so I picked another material called "crinoline", looks like this. I haven't worked on this fabric yet but other than risking people can see through the eyes, this fabric seem to be a good choice too.
http://gallery.timduru.org/v/Furry/Kofu/P1011615.jpg.html

So I made 3-D eyes with other colored thin foam sheet, it was really really hard to make the white part of the eyes, I kind got it alright but it's not perfect, wonder does anyone know how to draw and cut this part ?
http://gallery.timduru.org/v/Furry/Kofu/P1011622.JPG.html

Inside of the head, the gray bar is top of the head, white fabric with black stitches is where nose is gonna be. I was also thinking maybe try removable eyes like Scape goat did, but found out I did it on the wrong side and there is no way it can be removable now.
http://gallery.timduru.org/v/Furry/Kofu/P1011621.JPG.html

The final result http://gallery.timduru.org/v/Furry/Kofu/P1011630.JPG.html
Although this was a modifying project but in all, I am pretty pleased with how it turned out, and this is how he used to look like.

Ok, giving straight answers is one thing, but its another to give advice
without being able to see what you're talking about.  have you a better
picture?  Maybe one that shows what part of the eyes you're talking about
and maybe how to craft them or anything helpful?

Kofu I think it looks great!  Especially when comparing it to what it looked
like before.

Hey Kofu -good job on your first try!
I experimented with sharpie and it does not work nearly as well as  
flat black spray paint.  With the bruckram -you are not going to be  
able to see through it when it is white -thus the reason for painting  
it black on both sides.  I think I kept my buckram experiment strip  
here at home -white, sharpie on one side, sharpie on both sides,  
spray paint on one side and spray paint on both sides -and when you  
move it across your eyes, you suddenly can "see" when you get to the  
last one lol
Anyways,
I'll miss Twizzler -he was so cute -but I welcome the new... "Kofu"?  
oh what will his name be?

They wanted me fur a driving job that I could not legally do because I did
not have the right kind of driving license. They wanted me to get the
license before they would tell me if they would hire me. Since that would
have cost me $100 that I do not have I turned it down.

They might have me do a side job for promotional work. But I am not holding
my breath that they will call.

I am starting to think about going on line to look for sources of fax fur.
The companies around where I live either have cheep crap or are WAY over
priced. I know what I am looking at when I have it in hoof, but I cant
translate that into what online companies are selling. How can you tell when
an online company is selling good fur at a good price or if its over priced
crap? Looking at the photos on there web sites is not informative at all.

I'm pretty fond of distinctivefabrics.com and their long pile fur.. its very soft and good quality and price per yard aint too bad if you go for like the toon suit look.. um I dont do very many realistic suits but I have heard that prefurs I think it is, is a good source for that and is somewhat decent to pricey in cost per yard depending.

prefurs is out right expensive! I'm not paying no $159 per yard and all of
there faux furs are $159 a yard.

As for distinctivefabrics.com that is just a search engine.

My question is, how do I know if what someone is selling is a quality fur or
just over priced crap? When they describe there furs I don't know what there
saying.

My method, though slow and sometimes painful, is to have a saved search on
ebay and amozon and i just keep an eye out for good deals.  so far, i've got
enough fur for a grey wolf suit and i only paid $50 for the fur including
shipping.  Anyway, I hope that helps.

Do you know how to set that up? I would rather deal with India than China. I
avoid China when possible.

mto set it up you just need an email account. (should not be your home email if you want to keep it from being spamed from web sales). 

main web pages i use to email over seas company most have free samples you pay for shipping and will take small orders.).

Hedge". We believe most of you may be familiar with their comic, which can
be viewed here:

They will be joining our other Guest of Honor, Sofawolf Press, fine
publisher of anthropomorphic publications.

<http://www.sofawolf.com/>

We look forward to meeting our wonderful Guests of Honor at Further
Confusion 2010.


2. Annual Further Confusion Camp-out

We are now taking reservations for the FC2010 Camp-out, which will take
place on the nights of Friday August 21st and Saturday August 22nd.

Reservations are due by August 14th. Please send an email to
camping at furtherconfusion.org with the following info:

* Real and fan names

* Confirm ages of all members (Campers must be 18 years of age or

First come, first serve.

22nd, 2010.


3. Annual Further Confusion Picnic

The annual Further Confusion picnic will be held Saturday, August 22nd,
starting at 11:00 am at the Willow site at Lake Chabot.

The picnic is free and open to all - no RSVP required!

As usual, we'll provide the food and drinks. More food is always welcome,
though, as are folks to help out in setting up, cleaning, and otherwise
making the picnic happen. If you would like to bring some food or
condiments, please drop us a line at info at furtherconfusion.org and we can
let you know if we need anything in particular, or just mark down what
you're bringing.


4. Convention Book Art and Story Contest

FC2010 is proud to present a Con Book Art and Story contest. We will
randomly select two art winners and one story winner from all of the
entries, and each one of those winners will receive a Patron Level
membership to FC2010. The Con Book editor will then decide who gets
published in our Con Book form among all the entries, winners or not.

Deadline is October 1st!

A Patrons membership to FC2010 includes:
* A free FC2010 t-shirt
* Admittance to our catered Patron lunch with our Guests of Honor
* Cool goodies, such as our limited edition convention lapel pin and
  other gifts
* The ever so cool Patron badge.

The Rules
* Each artist and author is limited to one entry per person.
* Art , Stories and Poems have to be PG rated. No exceptions.
* Art should fit the theme of FC2010, which is "Gold Rush". In 
  particular, think of the Barbary Coast, not just the rush to 
  California but also the urban atmosphere of San Francisco during 
  those days; the parties, the opulence and the wild times.
* Poems, or Essays should also fit the theme as well.

For more information, please email conbook at furtherconfusion.org


5. Events

Now is the time of year when we are recruiting for panels. We have several
tracks of presentations including: Art, Writing, Fursuiting,
Science/Technology, Puppetry, Gaming, Social, Species, and Spirituality.
Please put your requests in early to have a better chance of being
scheduled. If you have something that you find interesting and is related
to furry fandom, email us at events at furtherconfusion.org


6. Dealers Room and Furry Market Place

As of our last meeting we have sold out of dealer tables entirely, but we
will have a waiting list available If you wish to be placed on the list,
please contact dealers at furtherconfusion.org. Also, watch the website for
news of when sales of tables within the Furry Market Place will begin.


7. Themed website launch

The much anticipated themed website for Further Confusion 2010 has
arrived! Many thanks go to Helvetica 'Foofers' Bold and Kipper for the

As it was said before, Only a fur can be told, "Your such a RAT!" and they
will thank you for being so kind.

The same can be said for my self. Say, "You are a total Jack Ass!" and I

 MFM 13 - Murder in Mephis


It was a dark and stormy afternoon Opening Ceremonies in Memphis at the 
Holiday Inn Select. Suddenly the lights go out, a scream, a thud! A crime 
has been committed! Do you pride yourself on your problem solving and 
observation skills? Local investigative office is currently seeking 
individuals for surveillance and various other activities. Experience not 
required but preferred. Pay rate negotiable based on history and experience, 
but will be paid on a pro bono basis.


Skunky Scuttlebutt

Labor Day Weekend 2009

Guest of Honor: Isfacat!!!


Isfacat, or Isfa for short, is an on-the-rise standup comedian of the sorts, 
but mostly a Jack-of-all-Trades.  He's searched and scoured the world for 
interesting subjects to speak of, and now he brings it all back to Memphis. 
His comedic styling can be described as stories equivalent to "Uncle Kage's 
Story Hour", a series of events that have happened to him in real life, but 
with his own little twist.

Isfa also leads his life as a professional computer gamer, and probably 
explains his addiction to Red Bull at this point.  He has been to a few 
events in Texas for said activity, and only twice has he acquired a trophy, 
but there's many more years to come.

If you spot him around the convention, whether in the Dealer's Den or maybe 
on stage, don't be afraid.  He's just like you, an ordinary man with an 
ordinary job, making a living as that guy you see who never leaves his 
apartment for anything but making a food run.


It will be here before we know it when Tyger will open MFM 13 with these 
words "Welcome Home". That's right, we are quickly approaching the start of 
Mephit FurMeet 2009, the place so many of us now call home. Make your plans 
now to attend one of the BEST gatherings in the furry community.


ALSO.......There will be a VERY SPECIAL announcement at Closing Ceremonies 
that you will NOT want to miss about MFM in the future!


--=={ T-Shirt Contest }==--


PLEASE READ THESE RULES IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE ENTERING.

The rules for 2009's T-Shirt Contest are:

1) What's up for grabs?

There are three chances for your artwork to be selected for MFM's T-Shirts.

    * Attendees Choice - The winner of the Attendees Choice will have their 
artwork featured on the front of the MFM T-Shirts. This is chosen by you, 
the attendees.
    * Director's Choice - The winner of the Director's Choice will be 
featured on the back of the MFM T-Shirt.
    * Staff Choice - This will be chosen by the staff and be featured on 
their staff shirts

Each winner will receive a free attending membership.

2) Who is eligible to enter?

Everyone! To be fair to all artists, we are continuing the requirement this 
year that the winner of the previous year's Attendees Choice will not be 
eligible for this year's Attendees Choice. They will still be allowed to 
enter, and may be considered for either the Director's Choice or Staff 
Choice.

3) What do I submit?
The overall rating for the piece should be a "G" to "PG" rating - if you 
wouldn't wear it in your elderly grandmother's house, don't put it on your 
entry! The piece must feature a skunk as the main subject or subjects. It 
should also bear either "Mephit FurMeet" or "MFM" as well as the year or 
corresponding anniversary number (i.e.: 2009 or 13). Entries that misspell 
the name of the convention will be disqualified.

For an entry to be eligible for voting, two versions of the entry MUST be 
submitted - one for display/voting, and a second, higher-resolution piece 
for use should that entry win or be selected for other use by a member of 
staff.

Display Piece: No more than 800 x 600, This display piece should not contain 
a signature to show who created this (We will go into more detail on this 
later). Artists need not worry about misuse of their artwork, as this piece 
will be watermarked by the staff as being an MFM T-Shirt Entry prior to 
being placed on the website for display. The "Display Piece" should be 
submitted as a .JPG or .GIF.

Final Piece: This will be the actual artwork used by our printing company to 
make the t-shirts, or the staff should your piece be used in any other 
function. This finished work SHOULD contain a signature which will appear on 
the t-shirt. The recommended dimensions are at least 10 inches high at 300 
dots per inch or higher. The "Final Piece" should be submitted in Adobe 
Illustrator (.ai) format, although TIFF or EPS will also be acceptable. This 
is by request of our printer that it be sent as Illustrator format.

Both the display and the final piece must be black and white ONLY (GRAYSCALE 
AND HALFTONED IMAGES ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE, PERIOD).

When the artwork has been received, you will be notified within 72 hours 
that it was received. If you did not receive a notification within 72 hours, 
please do not resend your email, but instead a follow up to see if it was 
received and the administrator of the contest just plain forgot *grin*.

4) Display of artwork

Once again, we will be running a 'blind' contest. We will only display the 
title of the piece, not who the creator is. By doing this, we hope to make 
the contest fairer by making everyone choose the submission based upon the 
piece itself, not the artist. Voting will be the same as in previous years - 
commencing for one week, after which votes determined to be ineligible will 
be discarded and the design which gets the majority of valid votes will be 
the winner.

After voting has finished and the director's choice has been selected, the 
t-shirt entry page will be updated with the names of the artists who 
submitted each entry.

5) When do you need it?
Cutoff Date for Submitting Entries is 11:59 PM Central time on Saturday, 
July 19, 2009.

6) Where do we send it?
Please submit all entries to tshirt2009 at mephitfurmeet.org

7) Other things.

Each artist may enter up to three pieces for inclusion in the contest. The 
administrator of the contest shall abstain from voting. The rules for voting 
will remain the same as in past years, where for a vote to be valid, the 
corresponding email address must be subscribed to one of Mephit FurMeet's 
mailing lists. IP Addresses will be logged, and MFM reserves the right to 
disqualify multiple votes from the same IP.

8) Some stuff you need to know (Better read it, it affects you!)

By submitting an entry to the Mephit FurMeet T-Shirt contest, you are 
granting Mephit FurMeet and its parent corporation, Mid South and Tennessee 
Anthropomorphic Arts Association (MST3A) an irrevocable, non-exclusive 
license to use the entry for promotional purposes. The original creators of 
the work are permitted to use the work in their own portfolios and 
promotions. Mephit FurMeet and MST3A reserve the right to review all entries 
and not allow any entry that it deems inappropriate (i.e.: drug/alcohol 
references, violent or sexual content, or possible trademark/copyright 
violations).

MFM shall in no way be responsible for entries that are lost in transit, 
either via email or postal service. If we do not receive an entry before an 
established cutoff date, the entry will not be included in the contest. 
Also, if you do not submit both required versions, your entry will not be 
included.

Dear Tyger,



The 2009 Convention is approaching quickly and as always everyone here is 
looking forward to hosting the event. Jose and I appreciated the time you 
took out of your busy day to discuss some very important issues and concerns 
that you had along with some of your attendees.



The following issues were discussed and will be handled as follows.

The hotel will provide the head of the convention security a extra security 
guard during the day hours and two during the evening hours to report 
directly to him. This will give you the flexibility to place security where 
you feel it is needed the most. You will have 100 % control of the security 
for the convention.

The Conference room locks that are being utilized during the convention will 
be tested to ensure that they are secure and in proper working condition.



The renovation is going to happen; it was pushed back due to the economy. 
The estimated start date has been set for the end of April we will be 
starting with the sleeping rooms first, we will work very hard  that this 
should not in any way effect your meeting room requirements or the guest 
rooms that your guest will be occupying . This is only a estimated time and 
could change, we will keep you updated.



We are glad to have everyone back this year and we will do everything to 
make sure your guests are happy and comfortable during their stay. If we can 
provide you with any further information please just let us know



Sincerely,

Jose Gallego

Karla Caudill

If you haven't heard already, Megaplex in Kissimmee, Florida, is coming up in just two 
weeks!  As the Megaplex Fursuiter Lounge caretaker, I want to offer a really great 
selection of amenities in the lounge this year, and in order to best reach that goal, 
I want to get input from other fursuiters.  With Anthrocon fresh on many suiters' minds, 
I figure that this is a perfect time to ask about fursuiter amenities for a sumertime 
furry convention.

Now, of course, we'll have plenty of cold water and an array of fans (you can't really 
call it a lounge without those staples, now can you?) I also already have the following 
items acquired for the lounge:

* Straws (10" long)
* Bedroom-style mirror (brand new)
* Febreze (TM) anti-bacteria spray
* Sewing / Repair Kit (freshly stocked with needles, threads, safety pins, & scissors)
* Several clocks (digital & analog)

In addition, I'll be posting a large-scale copy of the con schedule in the lounge and
the hotel will be providing towels.  I'll also be putting up an easel & flip chart
in the lounge on which I'll highlight the key fursuiter friendly events of each day.

Keeping in mind that hotel rules prevent us from providing any food or drinks (other
than water) in the lounge, is there anything else that I could provide in the lounge
that would help to make our fursuiters more comfortable?

Thanks and Cheers,
Santa Fox

A few things I didn't notice on your list that I've appreciated from 
other headless lounges:

- Towels.  Lots and lots of towels (small- or medium-sized ones are 
fine), constantly being restocked.
- A hot glue gun.
- Plastic cups and sharpies (or stickers maybe?) to mark the cups.
- Something to hold fursuit heads in front of a fan so they can dry.  
You can only fit so many on a table or chair, but you can fit a bunch on 
a custom hat rack or something similar.
- Gatorade mix.  Not sure if this works with the hotel rules you 
mentioned, but I've always greatly appreciated it.

-Uck!

Towels are nice, but in my experience, they're a logistical problem for 
the hotel - fursuiters go through them so quickly!  They're only used 
once; who wants to reuse a sweaty towel?

As an alternative, I suggest paper towels, preferably the fanfold kind.  
Yeah they're rougher, but still fine to get the sweat off.  As long as 
they're decent quality they won't fall apart.

Also, ask the hotel to provide garbage barrels.  Some hotels think 
they're providing a service by letting guests leave their garbage on the 
tables for the hotel to clean up, and that it looks nicer to not have 
garbage cans visible.  Furries are neater than that!

I like this idea..  our hotel is charging $1.50 per towel, and is only 
supplying like 45 per day.  Daubing sweat off and tossing into a trash 
can is really not a bad idea..

I'm almost half tempted to switch to C-Fold...  Of which I could supply 
myself, instead of hotel expense..  Hell..  There are even those 
disposable cloth like paper shop rags that actually do a very nice job 
of sweat absorbsion..  The come in a box, and pull out like tissues, and 
they feel like fabric..  I'm pondering..

Interesting idea going from regular towels to paper.

I would hope that the hotel would RECYCLE all those Paper towels if any
Con goes this way. I would hate for thousands of towels to be just tossed.

I would also hope that furs would be nice enough to toss them IN the
correct can.

The shop towels brand are called "TORK". Not sure how expensive though.

I like this idea..? our hotel is charging $1.50 per towel, and is only 
supplying like 45 per day.? Daubing sweat off and tossing into a trash 
can is really not a bad idea..

I'm almost half tempted to switch to C-Fold...? Of which I could supply 
myself, instead of hotel expense..? Hell..? There are even those 
disposable cloth like paper shop rags that actually do a very nice job 
of sweat absorbsion..? The come in a box, and pull out like tissues, and 
they feel like fabric..? I'm pondering..

What?! Not a single mention of sex AND it was a good piece?!? It was exciting to see Foxwell again.? I've known him in passing for a good few years, but it wasn't until FCN this year that I actually was able to sit down with him, Tilt, and Esopus and have dinner and a good conversation out of suit.

Last month a multimedia video team was here in New York and produced this
short piece exploring the relationship between fursuiting and identity.? It
featured interviews with?Foxwell?and Rattus?that were recorded
surrounding the studio taping of the RTR Show that week (so you see me in the
background only), plus additional insight by Jay Van Buren (the fursuit portrait
painter).

I was looking on Ebay for Surgical Towels. The ^%#^& people wanted more for
shipping that the product its self. What do they think we are some ^%$##%
that just fell off the moron truck!?!

I found a company that sels them with free shipping.
http://www.raglady.com/detail_W55-WEB__126__towels_rags_aviation_aerospace.html

The con can buy a couple hundred pounds of them have the used towels into a
barrel and take the used ones to the a Landry and wash them after the con is
over and use them the next year.

Yeah, Me, Teto, Pistol, and Pistol's roommmate were all there and refox was
there in suit (but i don't think redfox had a painting..)
anyways, Jay did paintings and then had sort of a gallery showing paint-off
the next morning.

and that was all of us posing for the painting :P and talking and
interacting, i was surprised to see that footage cause i don't remember ever
seeing a camera XD

I'm posting to this list because i figured some one could help me locate this specific fur. It is green with black guard hairs and about a 2 inch pile. Sorry if i come off as a N00b or a newb since i'v never really posted to this before. Any help is appreciated. I pretty much just need the website i can purchase it at as long as it ships to the USA. Yard minimum isnt a problem since i may be needing a large amount of the fur itself. 

Here is a link to the picture of the fur. http://i355.photobucket.com/albums/r476/Majy_the_dragon/3741127258_ac77c1d89b.jpg

It would be helpful if you said how much you need of it ( "a large amount"
doesnt say exact much ), and how much per yard you are willing to pay.

For the people that are experienced at buying fur over the net. How do you
know what you are looking at in fur. I have found a lot of fur that is in my
price range but I dont know if its over priced crap or a good quality fur. I
have seen some places that give an oz per yard but I don't know if what is
good. Also how do you know if the backing is soft enough for fursuit
building.

I've found that a good online provider will be happy to send you 
swatches for the cost of shipping (if not free). Call/e-mail and ask. 
The best way to score the material is to see/feel the material.

I was hopping that there was some kind of info that the company could
provide that I could save time form having to wait weeks for them to ship me
a swatch so I could eliminate there product.

1. Registration price change - Register today!

If you haven't pre-registered for Further Confusion 2010, now is the time!
Starting September 1st the price for pre-registration will go up to $45, so
get signed up at http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2010/registration today!


2. Overflow Hotel - The Sainte Claire

The AAE Board has signed a deal for the overflow hotel for Further Confusion.
That hotel is the historic The Sainte Claire Hotel, located across the street
from the Fairmont. The room rate is $119 per night. Reservations can be by
calling the hotel directly at (408) 295-2000 or toll free (866) 870-0726 and
asking for the Fur Con rate. The hotel is just a few hundred feet from the con
and each room offers refrigerators, DVD players, and complimentary wireless
internet (some rooms also have a wired port).


3. Badge Art Wanted!

Further Confusion is currently seeking artwork submissions for the 2010
membership badge inserts. Both color and black & white artwork will be
accepted, and all artwork will be considered on overall 'look and feel', plus
these additional points:

- Size: Art must scale to be printed at 4" x 2".
- Theme: Art must accurately reflect the theme of the con.
- Age appropriateness: The art must be suitable for viewing by children.

Artists submitting images should be aware that there is no payment for badge
art chosen, and the artist gives Further Confusion the right to reproduce the
image as badge art for FC2010. The artist will be credited on the insert and
in the con program book. The artist retains all other copyrights and
reproduction rights beyond the above.

Submission deadline is November 1st, 2009. All qualifying submissions will be
seriously considered and we will choose 6 designs. All artists will be
notified by December 1st as to whether or not their submissions have been
chosen.

Submission technical specs: We prefer JPG format at best possible quality
compression, at 300 DPI. An 8" by 4" original scanned at 300DPI gives us a
good file to work with. Badge art submissions should be sent to
badgeartsubmissions at furtherconfusion.org. In the email specify how you wish to
be credited should your art be chosen.


4. Dealer Room - Sold out - Waiting List taking applications

Our Dealer Room sold out in mid-June, and we are now taking Waiting List
applications. To get on the waiting list just use the existing Dealer Room
Table Application form that exists on the website fill it out just as if you
were buying a table, but when you send it in do NOT include ANY payment. This
will get you directly onto the waiting list.

-- How the Dealer Room Waiting List works

All those present on the Further Confusion 2010 Dealer Room Waiting List will
have an equal chance of getting a table should additional tables become
available or someone that currently has a table cancels. What we do is at the
time of selection from the Waiting List we made a random drawing from all
names on the list. This is NOT first-come, first-served. It is a Equal-chance
lottery from amongst all applications on hand at the time of the application.

We can make no promises to find space for those on the Waiting List. In many
years, all those on the waiting list either get in or drop off the list before
the convention starts in January. Other years very few people cancel and thus
few from the waiting list get a space. Cancellations most often happen in
December and January, just before the convention. Some happen only days before
the convention. We have no way to predict when a table will become available.

When we DO make an offer to someone from the waiting list, the offer will be
made by EMAIL. So make sure you put an email address that you check OFTEN on
the application. Offers usually must be responded to within 72-96 hours of
them being made, depending on how close to the convention it is. Payment will
be arranged for based on how close to the convention it is. If it's many weeks
before the convention, you will need to send in a check by mail. If it's only
days before the convention you will likely need to pay when you arrive at the
convention and claim your space.


5. Art Show Sales Open

The art show sales have opened! If you are interested in placing a piece,
please see http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2010/artshow for the rules and an
application form to be in the art show.


6. Furry Market Place

Sales of the Furry Market Place spaces will start Saturday August 1st, 2009.
The Furry Market Place is a non-adult (no material greater than PG-13 allowed
to be sold or advertised in this space) sales space in the hallway outside the
Dealer Room. Vendors with space in this area will need to set up and tear down
each of the three days that the space will be open as it is in non-secure
space (a hallway). Electricity is NOT a provided item in these spaces. You may
or may not get a space that may or may not have a working power plug near it.
All Furry Market Place spaces are 'wall' spaces.

These spaces will cost US$65.00 and come with a full membership to the
convention for the person purchasing the space. You may only purchase a SINGLE
space. If you need more than one space, get a friend to purchase one and work
together at adjacent spaces. (We can't promise to be able to place you next to
each other, but it is usually not a problem.)

To purchase a space, go to the Dealer Page on the Further Confusion 2010
website and you should find a Application Form in PDF format appearing there
before the end of July 2009. Print out and fill out the form and send it in
with payment (Personal Check or Money Order, please, made out to FURTHER
CONFUSION). The address to send it to will be on the application form. We sell
the spaces by postal mail ONLY. We do not sell these spaces online.

These sales will be processed in Postmark order, starting with those
postmarked August 1st, 2009 and continuing until we are sold out. We are
initially offering 20 spaces for sale. Sales will end on Tuesday, December
1st, 2009.

As with Dealer Room Tables, to make sales from a Furry Market Place space, you
MUST, by the first day of sales, have a Sales Permit # from the California
State Board of Equalization. A link to the CA BoE website is present on the
dealer page of the Further Confusion website.


7. Annual Further Confusion Camp-Out

We are now taking reservations for the FC 2010 Camp-out, which will take place
on the nights of Friday August 21st and Saturday August 22nd.

Reservations are due by August 14th. Please send an email to
camping at furtherconfusion.org with the following info:

* Real and fan names
* How many people will be in your party ($5 per person per night)
* Confirm ages of all members (Campers must be 18 years of age or accompanied
by a LEGAL guardian)
* Will you be bringing a vehicle ($5 per vehicle per night)

First come, first serve.

The campout will be held at Anthony Lake Chabot Campground the Oakland
Hills above Castro Valley. Camping is located just minutes from the
Further Confusion picnic being held at Lake Chabot on Saturday August 22nd,
2010.


8. Annual Further Confusion Picnic

The annual Further Confusion picnic will be held Saturday, August 22nd,
starting at 11:00 am at the Willow site at Lake Chabot.

The picnic is free and open to all - no RSVP required!

As usual, we'll provide the food and drinks. More food is always welcome,
though, as are folks to help out in setting up, cleaning, and otherwise
making the picnic happen. If you would like to bring some food or
condiments, please drop us a line at info at furtherconfusion.org and we can
let you know if we need anything in particular, or just mark down what
you're bringing.


9. Convention Book Art and Story Contest

Our Con Book Art and Story contest for FC2010 is ongoing and accepting
submissions! We will randomly select two art winners and one story winner from
all of the entries, and each one of those winners will receive a Patron Level
membership to FC2010. The Con Book editor will then decide who gets published
in our Con Book form among all the entries, winners or not.

Deadline is October 1st!

The Rules
- Each artist and author is limited to one entry per person.
- Art, Stories and Poems have to be PG rated. No exceptions.
- Art should fit the theme of FC2010, which is "Gold Rush". In particular,
  think of the Barbary Coast, not just the rush to California but also the
  urban atmosphere of San Francisco during those days; the parties, the
  opulence and the wild times.
- Poems, or Essays should also fit the theme as well.

For more information, please email conbook at furtherconfusion.org


10. Next Staff Meeting

There is no August staff meeting because of the FC 2010 Camp-Out and Picnic.
Our next staff meeting will be on September 12th, starting at 12pm in the San
Jose Fairmont. Parking is available in the surrounding area but is not free.
The parking lot closest to the hotel will run $7 for the duration of the
meeting.

Subject: FL: Dummy head
Message-ID: <d23d76ca0908311313w67d72653vdeaab490a09ac108@mail.gmail.com>

I had a heck of a time thinking of a way of making dummy heads for the
making fursuit heads. I needed some way of making the heads fit people that
are not around. Then I thought of doing it the same way that I have the
bodies. I thought of doing a duck tape dummy head. Of coarse I did have a
problem with my first duck tape dummy head victim, I mean volunteer, as he
had a nasty habit of insisting to be lowed to continuing on breathing. My
arguments of posterity went completely unheeded. People have such annoying
priorities. then thought of just tying him down to the chair and duct taping
his muzzles shut so I would not have to lessen to the consent complaints
about him breathing. But after thinking of the possible lawsuits and
criminal charges, Oh and more importantly his boyfriend is within hearing
range since he was in the other room, I dropped that idea as not feasible.
So after some additional brain storming, I came up with an answer that my...
volunteer would be willing to accept. I would do the entire head not
covering the mouth and nose area. When all that was left was that area I
would cut the person free of the head and right before I pulled it off I
would do the mouth area and immediately pull it off. So far my volunteers
are still friends. Oh yes, there also still alive.

How did others solve the head size problem?

If your making it so that is has to have an exact fit to the head then you
have no option but to cast your the persons head using straws in the nose,
dental alginate (non flavored, non menthol) on the face, and then wrapping
the head in plaster bandages with a seam down the side where the front half
overlaps the back half.

If it does not have to be exact but close to size the other option is
getting a full head armature from
http://www.monstermakers.com/product/deluxe-full-head-sculpting-armature-life-size.htmlit
is made of lightweight foam I use this for making latex masks by
building
clay onto then cast it using gypsunm cement and then I use the negative for
a latex slush mold. Not sure if this helps you or not. In most situations
whatever comes off that should fit most peoples heads unless their head is
oversized.

Another option I see is you could take general measurements of their head
then if there head is bigger then the dummy head you could build clay onto
the dummy to match the measurements of their head. You could use oil or
water based clay. Then build onto that.

I don't have the money for such expensive things. I can make a couple of
duct tape dummy heads at the cost of a $5 roll of duct tape, some stuffing,
and the use of a friends heads.

Duct tape dummy heads aren't that hard to do.  I've done two of them on myself with no help.  You leave an opening at the mouth and eyes, and make sure you have safety scissors before you begin.  I cut mine off along the jaw and cheeks to ensure I didn't give myself a haircut, then covered the eyes and mouth once removed when I repaired the cut line.  I then filled the head with spray insulation foam, done in layers as the first time I tried doing the whole head at once the stuff collapsed back into a liquid.  Ewwwww....

I use a baseball cap from Goodwill, fitted to the proper head size,
then build on that.

can be bought.

This has been mentioned before by others who have done lifecasting 
including me. *NO* straws up the nose. It's too easy to accidentally push 
them up there. Dental alginate can be used, but for most people, it sets 
too fast. You'll want slow set alginate found at Pink House or other 
places which sets in 7-10 minutes even with warm water.

As Donkey said, a duct tape head dummy can work. I did it to myself one 
time using saran wrap and not something stretchy. Just make sure you're 
not going to wear anything easily damaged, wrapping lightly for a general 
head shape.

I have a live cast of my head. The person that did it put straws up my nose
and used common cast bandages. Because it would cost me something like $500
to replace it I am not hot on the idea on using it to make foam heads on.

Yeah, I probably should have stressed the use of saran wrap or a plastic bag in my posts.  You don't duct tape directly to your head. :)

Subject: FL: Mannequin head supplier and other advice?
Message-ID: <4AA13113.2030401@gmail.com>

Hello,

I have recently started to work (in earnest) on my first fursuit.  It's 
going to be a Zangoose Pokemon (I hope, LoL).  I started with the foam 
block head method, Elliott's Spring Gathering had a workshop where I 
started the project but it sat in my closet for a few months.  I've 
carved the head features to a state where I think I'm ready to carve out 
a spot for my real head to fit.  So my general plan at this point is:

1. Acquire reasonably priced plastic mannequin head
2. Apply duct tape to the mannequin head such that it closely 
approximates the dimensions and volume of my real head
3. Carve out the foam head
4. Place a balaclava over the mannequin head and hot-glue the balaclava 
to the foam head
5. Cut and apply ears to foam+balaclava assembly
6. Using skin oils or other method (suggestions?) to make duct tape less 
adhesive, apply the tape to the foam+balaclava assembly
7. Draw pattern on the duct tape and then cut it to create a pattern for 
cutting fur
8. Use the duct tape pattern to cut fur, sew fur together (partially), 
fur the head
?. Affix eyes, nose, teeth, and other details (not sure where it's best 
to do these things order-wise)

Here's some photos of what I've got so far:
http://picasaweb.google.com/quincy.powell/Zangoose_Fursuit_project#

So, basically I'm interested in suggestions on where to get the 
mannequin head and any other advice concerning this process.
Since this is my first go at building one of these I'm sure I'll mess it 
up (more than I already may have), but that's all part of learning.  I'm 
not afraid of making mistakes and learning from them.

Thanks,
-Q

Affordable is all a matter of personal definition.  I've got a couple of
Monster Maker's heads that I like quite a lot.  At ~$55 a piece I don't
think they're all that expensive considering I've made five heads with them
so far.  They're light, durable and quite a good value, IMHO.

Subject: FL: Mouse attack emergency !  *worries*
Message-ID: <440552.89202.qm@web72207.mail.tp2.yahoo.com>

We just recently found sign of little mouse in our apartment (me and roommates actually saw the little critter, but never caught it). It's one of those little house mouse, very small. I found some of my clothes and dresser drawer covered by little mouse poo here and there, not a whole lot but yah POOPS.

Here is the question, I can pretty much wash all my clothes no problem, but what about my furs? I found some of the fur fabric has little poop on it, should I wash the entire fabric? (like at least a yard long or maybe longer) or can I just spray lyson over the fabric that has poop stick to it? Or should I throw the fabric away? *cries* T_T

Has anyone have their fur attacked by critters like mouse or roaches before? if you did, how did you handle the situation?


Thank you for reading

i would wash it twice.

hand wash in cold water first with vinegar, then with Woolite.

please don't just spray something on it and leave it covered in
filth......that's...yeah....eeew.

just hand wash it, scrub and clear away the debris, and everything will be
great.

vinegar will kill anything like mold or anything that wanted to grow in the
waste, and Woolite will clean everything else :)

good luck,
fuzzyroo

Use Endbac on mouse poop/pee already on/in fur? You gotta be kidding me. 
Have you seen the effects of cat pee on a mattress when your kitty is 
accidentally locked in a bedroom? ...and the smell... Ye gods... I almost 
lost my lunch... That mattress went down... Down the stairs and out the 
door with someone's help.

Use vinegar, then Woolite, as the other poster said. If you can, and got a 
buddy, take it outside and shake the fur out away from your residence. I 
picked up my cat one time from my neighbor's and for some STRANGE reason, 
he peed on me while I was carrying him. I had to wash my jacket and pants 
in vinegar first, then normal laundry detergent.

Ever seen the effects of old mouse pee on electronics? Total corrosion. I 
had to toss a couple electronic devices from storage when I was 
transferring stuff from cardboard boxes to plastic bins. I would imagine 
the same stuff would badly ruin the fabric.

For the Walmart stuff, that would be Great Value Antibacterial Spray 
Disinfectant, fresh linen scent.

Yes there is, it is called the Windows OS. Mice love bugs and worms
also they carry a great deal number of viruses. That is why you will
find a mouse in every of windows computer. If they did not trap mice
your computer you computer would work and you would not be supporting
so many branches of Microcrap.

Other than it's nasty and blah, is there a way to identify mouse pee? I saw people talking about it but so far I have only found its/their droppings, does it smells or does it have an actual spot you can "see"? I have a piece of fabric and it kind looks different in the middle, has this 1~2 inch wide weird texture on fur across the entire fabric (maybe about a yard or two) I don't think mice can pee this wide range? >_>;; but I'd like to ask you guys for sure

So far I haven't "smell" anything on my clothes and I washed them earlier today, I will spray my plushies and wash blanket cover today just in case.

Thank you all for the suggestions and help :3 Hopefully me and roommates will catch something today tomorrow *hugs all*

Here's a suggestion.  

After you wash your suit, hang it up, out of reach of the mouse.  If you can find a thick plastic garment bag, that would work even better.  Just put stuff in the bottom of it or where ever the mouse could chew in to keep it from getting in.  Then toss your head up above on a shelf.

The worst place to store a suit is in a heap on the floor or in a tote.  It needs to breath.  Even the garment bag is bad, but for short terms, it'll work fine.

You will most likely see it. They often pee thin little dribbles while
walking over things that are new to them, mainly if they are not alone.
Generally, it would look like thin discolored yellowish lines. When mice
are alone, they don't tend to pee much, but if there are multiple mice in
the same area, they will often mark over each others scent. They more often
mark each other than their surroundings. They also tend to mark very close
to walls, where they walk, rather than out in the open. One the other hand,
they will poop most anywhere, especially wherever they stop to eat. If they
pooped on some fur, it probably means that they food some food in the house
and carried it there to eat.

Their poo is very tiny and relatively hard. Because it is tiny, it dries
extra quickly, and usually leaves little to no smell. Their urine is rather
strong though - sort of a mixture of cat pee scent and an almost popcorn
like scent. You'll definitely know if there is urine. For the poo, I'd take
the fur outside and shake it or beat it well. This should take care of most
of the loose particles. Only after doing that would you want to spray the
fur. If you spray the fur while the particles are still there, it would
only soften the poo and make it stick in the fibers. I'd personally be more
worried about fleas, or other pests, that some mice carry, than about the
mice themselves. It's the fleas and other pests that some mice carry that
can be dangerous to people.

For spraying, use Enbac or Lysol. You could actually wash the fur, but the
additional wear it puts on the fur probably isn't worth doing that. We
probably get more undesirable stuff in our fur just by wearing and
interacting with people than from what the mouse managed to do. Just
imagine people at a con touching you, knowing that most of them probably
haven't washed their hands in weeks, let alone after using the bathroom.
That's not an exaggeration either. Most people simply don't wash their
hands after making a poo. It's not like a mouse could even compete with the
dirtiness of the average human!

The $2 per can Enbac clone that was sold at Walmart, appears to have been
discontinued. That was a product called "Great Value Disinfectant." They've
replaced it with something that smells entirely different, about three
months ago. Hopefully, this is just a temporary change, and they will start
carrying the good stuff once again. I tried three different Walmarts, with
no luck.

fox wolf, i would agree with the wear on the suit from washing it ONLY, and
mind you, ONLY ONLY ONLY  IF your machine washing it.

HAND WASHING is much safer and nicer to all fabrics and is recommended for
not only fur, but less durable materials like silk as well.

please, DO NOT just spray lysol on any disease carrying matter, like mouse
poo.  word's can not describe how disgusting that notion is.

As fursuiters i believe that there is a certain level of hygiene and
cleanliness we need to uphold when dealing with public matters, and walking
around a con or what ever with droppings covering your fur is well, horror
movie level of icky.

1. Overflow Hotel - The Sainte Claire

Our overflow hotel this year is the historic The Sainte Claire Hotel,  
located across the street from the Fairmont. The room rate is $119 per
night for double occpancy. Reservations can be by calling the hotel
directly at (408) 295-2000 or toll free (866) 870-0726 and asking for the
Fur Con rate.  The hotel is just a few hundred feet from the con and each
room offers  refrigerators, DVD players, and complimentary wireless
internet (some rooms also have a wired port).


2. Badge Art Wanted!

Further Confusion is currently seeking artwork submissions for the  
2010 membership badge inserts. Both color and black & white artwork  
will be accepted, and all artwork will be considered on overall 'look  
and feel', plus these additional points:

- Size: Art must scale to be printed at 4" x 2".
- Theme: Art must accurately reflect the theme of the con.
- Age appropriateness: The art must be suitable for viewing by children.

Artists submitting images should be aware that there is no payment for  
badge art chosen, and the artist gives Further Confusion the right to  
reproduce the image as badge art for FC2010. The artist will be  
credited on the insert and in the con program book. The artist retains  
all other copyrights and reproduction rights beyond the above.

Submission deadline is November 1st, 2009. All qualifying submissions  
will be seriously considered and we will choose 6 designs. All artists  
will be notified by December 1st as to whether or not their  
submissions have been chosen.

Submission technical specs: We prefer JPG format at best possible  
quality compression, at 300 DPI. An 8" by 4" original scanned at  
300DPI gives us a good file to work with. Badge art submissions should  
be sent to badgeartsubmissions at furtherconfusion.org. In the email  
specify how you wish to be credited should your art be chosen.


3. Art Show Sales Open

9. A bit of San Francisco Gold Rush History (courtesy of Flint Otterhall)

January 24, 2009 will be the 160th anniversary of the Calfornia Gold Rush.
On that date in 1848, the first gold discovery in California took place at
Sutter Mill. At the time, the population on San Francisco was 575 males, 177
females and 60 children.

By September of 1848, the Gold dust price was set at $16 per ounce In the
first 6 months of 1849 over 697 ships arrived in San Francisco Harbor.
Steamers, Clipper ships, and all manner of vessels made the voyage. Many did
not survive the journey around Cape Horn. The Steamer fare between San
Francisco and Sacremento was $30 and took between 9 and 12 hours. The "Red
Light District" of San Francisco was termed the Barbary Coast. By Dec 31st
of 1849, the population of San Francisco was estimated at 100,000 including
35,000 people who came by sea, 3000 sailors who deserted ships and 42,000
who came overland.

Over the next 17 years more money, opulence, bawdery, and economic growth
took place in northern California than ever before, and perhaps even since.
It was the first Boom/Bust cycle that still seems to echo in the Bay Area
economy to this day.

San Francisco at that day was a lively place. Gold, or placer digging as
it was called, was at its height. Steamers plied daily between San
Francisco and both Stockton and Sacramento. Passengers and gold from the
southern mines came by the Stockton boat; from the northern mines by
Sacramento. In the evening when these boats arrived, Long Wharf-there was
but one wharf in San Francisco in 1852 was alive with people crowding to
meet the miners as they came down to sell their "dust" and to "have a
time." Of these some were runners for hotels, boarding houses or
restaurants; others belonged to a class of impecunious adventurers, of
good manners and good presence, who were ever on the alert to make the
acquaintance of people with some ready means, in the hope of being asked
to take a meal at a restaurant..." Ulysses S. Grant (1852)

Would you like to see what future President Grant saw?

Message-ID: <4AC55DFE.2020007@wideopenwest.com>

   I'm embarking on making a furrier fox tail but keep running into the 
same issue: the point where the colour and the white tip are sewn 
together is easily visible if the fur bends. Granted, it's not stuffed 
yet but it does make me wonder what other furs have done (if anything) 
to make this look like one smooth piece. I've noticed this is much more 
detectable with fur that contrasts more. And, yes, this is being hand 
sewn instead of machine. Is this something that can be treated by 
trimming down the underlaying white prior to sewing? Thanks for your input.

My suit was not made by "fursuit.or" I suggested it as a resource to help you make your own, there are lots of tutorials and topics covering the construction in the archives.  My suit was made by Joecifur, of b3 mascots, for an anime con.   Not sure what his current pricing is or if he is even accepting comissions, it's also somewhat unlikely he would make a duplicate suit

Duplicate most likely not. Something similar that does not look like a
copy maybe. I have seen a guy that loved a suit that someone else had
and wanted one like it so he had one made. You could never mistake one
for another but you can see the influence. The original fursuiter
seemed cool with the new suit and had lots of photos taken of the two
fursuits.

When you said some one had a duplicate of an original suit made. Are you talking about Ditto and Radjin ? Also to the OP there's a cosplay fursuit company that might make you a Buizell i think its called Cosfurs.

Hmmmm.  I own a Joecifur Gold Fox head. Two years after my purchase, I saw
an identical head at FC.  Duplicates may be possible...  your mileage may
vary.

I have been contacted by someone saying that they would like me to
copy someone elses work and I refused. Well the first and minor reason
the head that they wanted copied was beyond my ability. The second and
bigger reason was I did not feel comfortable copying others work. I
told them that I would make something that would look something close
to it but not the same. Since I did not hear back from them I am
guessing they went somewhere else.

Not quite sure how to work that cosfur page or find it in the Cosplay company page. I looked around but couldn't really find it. But as for the fursuit I am not trying to copy the one I seen. first it going to be at least 6ft 5'' at least. and the rest I can't really say since someone might steal the appearance.

So that I am aiming for and looking for help to see if anyone could help me find the right person or website to help me create this Buizel Fursuit. Any best opitions guys?

Depends on the cost and how real you want the suit and how long you want it for. if it just for one or two cons or your short on cash then i would look to an over seas mascot maker. it wont be the best costume but for a new fur suiter there not bad. if your looking to keep the suit for awhile and want it to last you may want to look at http://www.dangerousdinos.com/

or there http://www.anthrocreations.dyndns.org:100// 

when it comes to fursuits you have to ask do you want it toony or as real as it can get. do you want to have a working mouth and any other parts like working wings or led lighting if your a dragon or monster. also how you store and clean your costume will effect on how long it last. as picking up a large tub or bag to keep the suit clean and the foam from moving in the body suit or having the head become mishapped. when it comes to one fursuit maker copying another works a lot of furs wont do that. at a lot of cons when you see a lot of same wolfs/tigers is that a lot of new suiters have bought the same cookie cutter suits from on line retailer. thouse suiters then add clothing/jewelry to change the look to make it there own. I would look at some of the online photos from some of the big fur-suit cons and read the fursuit posting on con boards for makers that look like they can make a suit in the stile you like. when you do fine a good maker of suits for you have the build planned out ie a duck tape dummy of yourself. a payment plan ie how much to start and when the suit gets to a set point and the rest before it ships. also pick up fur samples now from fur vendors as not all fur is the same. a lot of furs have scraps that if your looking for one or two color can drop a sample or two in the mail for you.

the suit I want made isn't like that Buizel suit at all for the most part, I want to look more like my personally charcater Buizel. that what I am really aiming for. Also with cost I am saving money for it already. If my esimations are correct in four months I will have the money I need to go for a good fursuit. At this time I want to find a good place to make it.

I am already starting to draw designs of it. So I hope to find amazing fursuit place that would create it when the time comes to paying for it. I also like to thank for the help and information you all been giving me

What do you need help with?  My method uses a baseball cap as the  
base, a structure of plastic mesh, and fine shaping with added foam  
rubber.

Depends on what the final design is to be. You can use casting resin (requires many products), paper mache', foam over mesh, wire mesh, carved foam block. Personally, I use casting resin and create the mother mould from clay.

I use a mix of things, I've done the foam head with a moving jaw that
requires no wire, and I've also done the mesh, and also the ninja hood
technique, I like the Ninja hood better thus far, the foam made my head a
bit to big, and what not. the ninja hood was a tighter fit and moved easier
with my movements nad didn't seem like it could be pulled right off, I also
used a paint palete for the eyes, the circular little bubble paint paletes,
they make great follow me eyes.

I don't think just any paper cut outs would work, it all depends on how you
build the head itself, the cut outs otherwise could be too big ot too small
or not spaced the right way. your best bet is to make the head then use
tracing paper to map out fur placements, tracing paper is ideal cause its
not extremly tough like normal paper, so its easy to get into the creases
like behind and around the ears. hope this helps

Where you get the idea where any of that is funny I have no idea. He
is a jerk that goes around and hurts others for his own sick pleasure.
He should be locked up either in jail or a psychological ward to
protect the public from him, depending on if he does it because he is
in his right mind or not.

I don't think it is nice say the video that Steven has shared with us
is not funny. He found something that amused him and wanted us to see
it too.

Would you appreciate it if people said things you have shared with the
public are not funny or that they didn't like them? I would imagine
your feelings would be hurt if people reacted that way toward you.

If I was a feel good bleeding hart liberal what you said about me
would have been very hurtful of my feelings.

I am not some feel good hart bleeding liberal that thinks that if we
just took the time to sit down and talk so we can understood someone
that that just murdered an entire school of children everything will
be better. Some people just need to be put down for the better of
everyone else. Remi Gallard is one of the people that needs to be
locked up for everyone else's safety, be that jail or a psychological
ward is for the courts and head shrinks to decide.

I have seen some of Remi Gallard's videos. One of them is of him going
down a street grabbing parking tickets off of parked cars. If the
owner of the car got the ticket they could have just paid the fine and
that would be it. But since they did not know of the ticket they could
have been arrested for failing to pay the fine that they never knew
about. I dont find that funny in the least. I bet if you where one of
Remi Gallard's victims you would not think his actions are not funny
in the lest anymore.

See....  He's gone and made an ass of himself again.

But seriously...  While its nice the video was posted...  Its still a form of humour that I don't understand or appreciate.  Different strokes for different folks.

But the whole bleeding heart liberal comments were way of basis.

I disagree. That Video had nothing supportive for the fursuiting
community to talk about. Its all about how to be a jerk and to ruin
other peoples visit to the zoo just for his own pleasure and what ever
fan base that he has. People that like it should be shown what he
really is so his fan base will dry up. If people don't pay attention
to him and egg him on eventually he will stop.

I don't agree. What I would agree to is it would have been wiser to
respond to Tsuyoto Wolf off list. I am not the only person that sent a
E mail that should have had a little more thought of where it was
going before hitting the send butten.

Call me naive but what does any of this have to do with fursuiting? And who cares about politics even if you are or despise librals? So how about we drop the issue altogether because it has no point and neither does arguing about it and discuss something relavent, for example which have you seen more of: original handcrafted fursuits or cookie cutter mass produced ones?

I don't think it is nice say the video that Steven has shared with us
is not funny. He found something that amused him and wanted us to see
it too.

Would you appreciate it if people said things you have shared with the
public are not funny or that they didn't like them? I would imagine
your feelings would be hurt if people reacted that way toward you.

If I was a feel good bleeding hart liberal what you said about me
would have been very hurtful of my feelings.

I am not some feel good hart bleeding liberal that thinks that if we
just took the time to sit down and talk so we can understood someone
that that just murdered an entire school of children everything will
be better. Some people just need to be put down for the better of
everyone else. Remi Gallard is one of the people that needs to be
locked up for everyone else's safety, be that jail or a psychological
ward is for the courts and head shrinks to decide.

I have seen some of Remi Gallard's videos. One of them is of him going
down a street grabbing parking tickets off of parked cars. If the
owner of the car got the ticket they could have just paid the fine and
that would be it. But since they did not know of the ticket they could
have been arrested for failing to pay the fine that they never knew
about. I dont find that funny in the least. I bet if you where one of
Remi Gallard's victims you would not think his actions are not funny
in the lest anymore.

See....  He's gone and made an ass of himself again.

But seriously...  While its nice the video was posted...  Its still a form of humour that I don't understand or appreciate.  Different strokes for different folks.

But the whole bleeding heart liberal comments were way of basis.

Have they really introduced legislation in France making fursuits  
illegal because of this?  Wow...I don't like this video...at  
all...but knee-jerk reactions on a governmental level such as this  
are LAME.

Not yet, but what I mean is that it's already difficult enough to go out 
in suit in public places without having the security or police asking you 
what you are doing and such.
Usually if you just comply to everything they ask for and explain to them 
calmly it's fine.
But if the kind of behaviour like Remy Gaillard gets known and spreads,
their first reaction will be to kick us out.

In France Mascots are not very common, so if their first contact with a 
"mascot" / fursuit is Remy Gaillard, they're not really gonna be very 
receptive the next time they see one.
Be it regular people or the police / security.
That last outing of his in the zoo, simply ruins all chances to be able to 
perform there I'm afraid.

As a general rule it's something to keep in mind when someone goes out in 
fursuit,it's fun , people love it,
but that person has to keep in mind that his behaviour is going to imprint 
what people will think of fursuits.
In France it's often their first contact with a fursuit.
And well as we say the first impression tends to last forever.

It's already enough to give a good image because of all the bad press 
crap, so now we have also a crazy performer around beating everyone and 
stealing and so on to deal with.

Not necessarily, if the zoo is presented with an offer by furs as
professional performers that are licensed and bonded street performers
things could be worked out. That is if Remy Gaillard did not do that
to get the costumes into the zoo in the first place. If that is what
he did there is no hope they would be fools to let it happen again.

It might be worth the expense of becoming licensed and bonded street
performers to undo the damage that he and other copycats might do just
to bring fursuits into a very positive light there in France. Here in
San Francisco there is a group called "Critters By The Bay" that does
something like that. I can't tell you to much about the group, I am
not a member because I disagree with there anti furry rules and
policies. Here is there website http://www.crittersbythebay.com/ you
can look at to give you a starting point if you would like to start

The security services are already on edge and quick to move suiters on in high risk areas. 

The last thing we need is someone going out there and causing trouble to the point that we won't be able to suit.

Have they really introduced legislation in France making fursuits  
illegal because of this?  Wow...I don't like this video...at  
all...but knee-jerk reactions on a governmental level such as this  
are LAME.

Here in the New York City area we have Hi-4 Entertainment which has been  
successful in promoting our 'suiting activities at local community and 
chartity  events.

Not  necessarily, if the zoo is presented with an offer by furs as
professional  performers that are licensed and bonded street performers
things could be  worked out. That is if Remy Gaillard did not do that
to get the costumes  into the zoo in the first place. If that is what
he did there is no hope  they would be fools to let it happen again.

It might be worth the  expense of becoming licensed and bonded street
performers to undo the  damage that he and other copycats might do just
to bring fursuits into a  very positive light there in France. Here in
San Francisco there is a group  called "Critters By The Bay" that does
something like that. I can't tell  you to much about the group, I am
not a member because I disagree with  there anti furry rules and
policies. Here is there website  http://www.crittersbythebay.com/ you
can look at to give you a starting  point if you would like to start
your own group to promote fursuiting there  in  France.

We have a similar group hear in the California Bay Area called
Critters By the Bay. Through careful planning and rules, they are able
to maintain a level of professionalism. Many local zoos, kids' parks,
and parades trust the group. Like Hi-4, it is been successful in
keeping a positive image for public fursuiting.

Our website is http://www.crittersbythebay.com

That is so awesome.  It's too bad that they don't have a price on that page.
 I would so love to buy some for my husky suit, esp if they came in more

I would send an email to the company to see if they has some product samples or speak with someone in there sales dept for a sales info. or see if they have a local rep near you. I spoke to a local beta led rep last year and was able to get two led street lights for our town at sample price.

Oh Dear - for the past 5 years Marcwolf has had LED eye lights to simulate 
pupil's

Have a look at http://marcwolf.org - I have simulated the eyes on the main 
picture. When I am interacting with people it really gets their attention 
and keeps it too as they feel they are relating to a real creature rather 
than a character with no facial expressions.

Take Care

Perfect hidden zips

Hi Folks
I decided to post this as I am often asked to put in zips of various sorts
so that they are hidden from the viewer.

The best method I have found is this

1. Mark where you want the zip on the back of the fur fabric with chalk.
Markers are fine but remember you want to keep the opening area as uncolored
as possible. A marker could stain the edges of the cut fabric and thus make
it noticable.

2. Using contact glue give a light coating on the back of the fur fabric
where the zip will be, making  sure that there is enought to glue the zip
down.

3. If using an invisible zip put a light coating of contact glue on the
fabric or invisible side, or with a normal zip just the two fabric sides.

4. Place the zip onto the fur fabric - pressing down to make sure that the
contact glue connects and seals. This not only holds the zip in place before
sewing but also keeps the edges of the fur fabric down where one cannot
easily sew.

5. With matching thread - hand sew a running stitch along each side of the
zip as close to the teeth as possible. Repeat this about 5mm's away from the
first line of stitches for additional strenght.

6. Carefully slide open the zip to reveal the fur fabric underneath and with
a very sharp knief or single sided razor blade cut the  opening.


When the zip is closed you should see very little change to the fur on the
outside. The use of contact glue both holds the zip as well as seals the
underlying fur fabric edges.  If the zip handle is too prominant then a
small fur fabric flap can be added to hide this.


Hope this helps some folks.

A lot of people wear glasses nowadays, and sometimes trying to wear the
glasses whilst in a fursuit can be.. problematic.

I work in a optical lens grinding plant, and I asked my manager if it was
possible to take a perscription and  recalculate it so that the glasses were
further away from the face. And it is.

So - if you really need glasses  then I can get a pair of optical blanks
made up (70mm diameter plastic) and they can be installed in your suit.

These lenses are the standard optical quality plastic lenses and you can
shape them using a dremel etc.

You can install them something like an outer covering on your suit's eyes.


So - if you know your perscription, and you know the distance between your
character's eyes and your eyes - then it can be done.  I am still working
out the cost but it will be approx $40 for a clear uncoated pair. More for
specialised anti glare and tinting.

Hope this can help some people

Having just come back from deployment a few months ago I can tell you 
that lens adapted to a greater distance from your face, such as in a gas 
mask, do work though it takes a bit getting use to.  I'm hoping to see 
if I can recycle my gas mask lens into one of my fursuit heads later in 
the year.

Ok, I'm not trying to be a party pooper or anything but please be sure that you do this deal totally under the table.  Prescription glasses are medical devices that must be obtained with a prescription by an eye doctor.  Now either do it under the table or see about getting some kind of specialty prescription for this purpose.

Hi Aiden

These will be totally above board. These are quality lenses ground in a
professional laboratory. The company I work with pride themselves in
providing the highest standards, and our equipment is state of the art
(Nidek, Shamir, Innovations).

What I am offering is  for you to provide your perscription, and the
distance between your eyeball and where you wish to mount the lense and we
can calculate the optical changes and grind the lenses to those parameters.
You will be dealing directly with the laboratory via myself (So I can
monitor the progress of the production and advise re the inlab testing of
the lenses).

We have in the past ground lenses that will fit into IPOD video glasses so
that the wearer can use the miniture TV spec without needing their own
glasses. We have also ground lenses that go into scuba masks, special safety
lenses.

If you want - you can talk to your own medical people re changing the
perscription so that the glasses are essentially further from your face like
in a mask. They will be happy to do that for you however you will find the
price considerable.

As for the costs - we grind the lenses so we are the people who do the
work.. So essentually you are getting the items at wholesale price rather
than going through several resellers.

Multicoating and tinting will be extra, and  we can only do a single focus
as calculating progressive or bi-focals without physically having the suit
and the wearer there will be too difficult.

Hopes this help.  I can provide the name of the lab upon request however as
we are a wholesaler our advertising and marketing is not web based (we do
not want to be seen as competing with our customers - the optomertrists who
send work to us)

Take Care

Marc

If you have a fursuit, are pre-registered, and would like a fursuit badge,
here's what to do. 

Check out <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2010/policies/fursuit_badges>
for what you need to do to get a fursuit badge.


2. Con Book Art/Story winners

Thanks again to all who entered the con book story/art contest this year.
The winners this year received a patron membership to the convention:

Art winners: 
- Truro the Lost for "Dance-Hall Gal", partial-page illustration 
- Zaos for "Blazing Sunset", partial-page illustration

Writing winner:
- John Barberio for "Little Wah & the Golden Dragon's Roar"

Congratulations to all!


3. One-day Con Badge Prices

We'd love to have everybody for the whole con, but if you can only stay a
day we've got day badges! See below for the price of a day badge for each
day of the convention; they can be bought at Registration at the con
itself.

Thu: $20
Fri: $25
Sat: $30
Sun: $25
Mon: $20


4. Dealers Room

The Dealers Room is sold out, however we were able to send out a round of
invites to our waiting list. If you were on our waiting list, please check
your email, as you might have received a table offer from us! If we don't
hear back from those people we sent offers to, we -might- have a table
left. And if any cancellations happen, that would also free up a table for
the waiting list.


5. Furry Market Place

Sales of the Furry Market Place spaces are now closed. No more spaces will
be sold. If you still want to sell things at Further Confusion 2010 and
you don't have a space in the main Dealer Room or the Furry Market Place,
then your only chance is if someone else cancels AND you have sent in a
Waiting List application (available on the Dealer Page of the Further
Confusion 2010 website).


6. Overflow Hotel - The Sainte Claire

Our overflow hotel this year is the historic The Sainte Claire Hotel,
located across the street from the Fairmont. The room rate is $119 per
night. Reservations can be by calling the hotel directly at (408) 295-2000
or toll free (866) 870-0726 and asking for the Fur Con rate. The hotel is
just a few hundred feet from the con and each room offers refrigerators,
DVD players, and complimentary wireless internet (some rooms also have a
wired port).


7. Gold Strike at Further Confusion 2010!

It's true ladies and gents. I saw the first nuggets today and I assayed
them as genuine gold nuggets from the strike area in Northern California.
It has been said that every member who manages to make it to Further
Confusion 2010, even as a mere attendee, will get a sample from their
claim. Now you folks know that a good claim is worth more than stock in
the Pacific Union Railway, but many of those are just dead end tracks.

Be sure and check your tailings bag you will receive at Registration. Most
will sadly just have the illusion of Fools Gold, but for 30 lucky claim
owners, their bags will contain a genuine Northern California Gold nugget
of approximately 1 g.


8. Parking at the Fairmont

Parking for FC2010 can be really cheap, or even free! This all depends on
your arrival and departure times and careful examination of the fee and
time schedules for the public parking lots. 

Check out our Parking Information page at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2010/hotel/parking> for more details.


9. Complimentary High-Speed Internet Access at the Fairmont

A reminder for those who have booked rooms at the Fairmont: Be sure to
join Fairmont's President's Club. There are many benefits including
express check-in, free local calls, and perhaps most importantly,
complimentary in-room Internet. Enrollment is free. Follow this link
<https://www.fairmont.com/fpc/FPCEnroll> to sign up.


10. Further Confusion 2010 Night Time Dance Schedule

Once again, we have great things planned for the dances at Further
Confusion. Since we've moved into a great new hotel which offers us more
convention space than ever before, we've also expanded on the dances. In
addition to the dance music we'll have in the Imperial Ballroom, there's
another great space (looks like a mini-ballroom) known as the Club Regent
where we'll also be having music of different genres.

We are lucky to have so many talented DJ's and musicians, both
professional and amateur, donating their time and skills to perform for
you. They all do this for the love of the music and the fandom.

We will also be bringing back "Live! Action! Drawing!" This is the big
easel on the stage during the dances. Instead of scheduling artists in
advance, we thought it would be fun to find artists at the time. So if
you're an artist and you're at the dance and interested in doing some
drawing, find the pink and green bunny and let him know.

In the next few weeks, keep an eye out on the forums and elsewhere for
full bios on all the DJ's/musicians and details of the different dance
events.

The Dance schedule can be found on our website at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2010/schedule/hours#dances>


11. Next Staff Meeting

Our next staff meeting will be on January 9th, starting at 1 pm in the San
Jose Fairmont. The final meeting will be on January 16th at the same time
and is mandatory for all staff. Parking is available in the surrounding
area but is not free. The parking lot closest to the hotel will run $7 for
the duration of the meeting.


12. Clementine: A History

Oh My Darling, Clementine is an American western folk ballad usually
credited to Percy Montrose (1884), even though it's sometimes referred to
Barker Bradford. The song is believed to have been based on another song
called Down by the River Liv'd a Maiden by H. S. Thompson (1863).

Clementine's grieving admirer originally used her first name in the song.
After singing the new song to the deceased's family relation they objected
to the use of her first name, embarrassed that people would then know
their own daughter could not swim. To make the family happy the maiden
fair's real last name was used and changed slightly in order to rhyme with
other words in the song.

Clements was the real last name of the maiden fair; she was born in
America to the descendant English noble family (relation to Captain
Benjamin Clements of Virginia) with intermarried maternal blood lines to
Scottish Royalty. During the 1800s women of this family were renowned for
their natural captivating beauty which caught the eye of the song's
creator. Lady Clements fell into the water near her own home and drowned
because she did not know how to swim. Although Clementine's Father was not
truly a 49er he was a farmer, this portion was added due to the popularity
of the gold rush at the time and its ability to rhyme in the song.

The words are those of a bereaved lover singing about his darling, the
daughter of a miner in the 1849 California Gold Rush. He loses her in a
drowning accident, though he consoles himself towards the end of the song
with Clementine's "little sister".

The verse about the little sister was often left out of folk song books
intended for children, presumably because it seemed morally questionable.

Another theory is that the song is from the view of Clementine's father,
and not a lover.

Gerald Brenan attributes the melody to originally being an old Spanish
ballad in his book South from Granada. It was made popular by Mexican
miners during the Gold Rush. It was also given various English texts. No
particular source is cited to verify that the song he used to hear in the
1920s in a remote Spanish village was not an old text with new music, but
Brenan states in his preface that all facts mentioned in the book have
been checked reasonably well.

Lyrics

In a cavern, in a canyon,
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner forty niner,
And his daughter Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling,
Oh my darling, Clementine!
Thou art lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Light she was and like a fairy,
And her shoes were number nine,
Wearing boxes, without topses,
Sandals were for Clementine.

Oh my darling, oh my darling,
Oh my darling, Clementine!
Thou art lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Drove the ducklings to the water
Ev'ry morning just at nine,
Hit her foot against a splinter,
Fell into the foaming brine.

Oh my darling, oh my darling,
Oh my darling, Clementine!
Thou art lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Ruby lips above the water,
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine,
But, alas, I was no swimmer,
So I lost my Clementine.

Oh my darling, oh my darling,
Oh my darling, Clementine!
Thou art lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

How I missed her! How I missed her,
How I missed my Clementine,
But I kissed her little sister,
I forgot my Clementine.
