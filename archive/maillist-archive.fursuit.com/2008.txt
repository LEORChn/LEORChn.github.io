I have some that is rust colored, but fades into a darker color...really the
perfect fabric for a fox suit. I need way more for a project, so if anyone
has some they are willing to sell, or know where I can but it, please let me
know.

Hey there,
I just bought some actually, (their last 4 yards!) at Pacific Fabrics in
Seattle where I live.  I believe it is possible to get their fur fabrics via
Internet mail order.

http://www.pacificfabrics.com/

If they don't have it, try Mendel's, in SF, but also online at
mendels.com(it might be .net)
They have a ridiculous amount of fur, it's amazing.  And they can send
little samples of it, for free (or at least cheap).  Hope this helps you on
your epic fur-quest!

Hi Furs,

I have a slight problem here. 
I ordered a Tiger Body form Darkstone costumes for a local basketball club. Because is now 4 months I'm waiting on the payed body i tryed to contact then - with no result. Mail and phone does not work anymore.
So could if possible someone of you and knows the guys ask em whats happen ?

I have the slight feeling that i've been riped off again.

Beside that I need further information.
Because my basketball club is desperate waiting on the suit i will sew em here in my Mascot Workshop ( I have the Cut Pattern of the Costume here). But i have a big problem they used cheap fun fur for the suits and this brand is not sold in Europe. So does someone of you have a online resource of that fur in the US or even a fabric store next to get it.

Here a picture of the tiger for the colors.

Greetings

PS: And does someone has the addy of Dogz a're Barking he is also on my to do list???

They are now known as "Realms of Enchantment" and have been for some time.
http://realms.safeshopper.com/

Latest information from their website is:*
Address:*
8 E Palomar St.
Chula Vista, CA 91911
*Phone:* 1-619-425-0068*
Email:* darkstone-realm at juno.com <mailto:darkstone-realm at juno.com>

Hope this helps. They have been "spotty" at times with deliveries, but 
if you keep after them, they have responded in the past. They also have 
been notoriously difficult and late with some "custom" designs, so if 
that is the case, just keep after them. And much of their fur striping 
and design is airbrushed into the fur, so there may not be a suitable or 
easy to find one-for-one replacement.

furfinder does not work because its not updated. The last I looked at it
years ago. You don't know if the info was entered last week or ten years
ago. Some one could have moved 5 times since they said where they lived or
they might not be furs anymore.

I will try wikia out thanks. I did not think of looking there

I will try wikia out thanks. I did not think of looking there

Subject: FL: Final FC2008 Pre-Con Newsletter
Message-ID: <20080118215347.GA60473@critter.net>


The very last newsletter for FC2008. This time, we're covering the
following:

1.  Dealer's Room
2.  Furry Market Place

4.  Hotel Information
5.  Furly Edition
6.  Preliminary Schedule and Important Times

                              _ . o O o . _ 

1.  Dealer's Room

Dealers Room is sold out. Waiting List is closed and is not adding more
people. Those of you on the waiting list still have a chance if there are
any cancellations.

Dealers, pease check your postal mail, you should have gotten a
confirmation packet with your personal information and the Dealer Room
Rules for the year. If you have not gotten your confirmation packet,
contact dealers at furtherconfusion.org and we will get your mailing address
corrected and a new confirmation packet sent to you. This information is
also on the Dealers area of the website.

Dealers, if for ANY reason you will NOT make it to the convention, contact
dealers at furtherconfusion.org as soon as you are aware that you won't make
it to the convention.


2.  Furry Market Place

Furry Market Place sales are closed. Waiting List is closed and is not
adding more people.

Furry Market Place vendors, please check your postal mail, you should have
gotten a confirmation packet with your personal information and the Furry
Market Place Rules for the year. If you have not gotten your confirmation
packet, contact dealers at furtheronfusion.org and we will get your mailing
address corrected and a new confirmation packet sent to you. This
information is also on the Dealers area of the website.



3.  Box Office / Anime 

Once again, the Bay Area Animation Society is bringing anime to Further
Confusion!

Anime will be running in the Santa Clara Room (by the bathrooms next to
Club Maxx) from 7:00 pm Thursday evening to half past noon on Monday.

The anime titles themselves will shift back and forth between the cutting
edge and older favorites. Be sure to check the showing schedule on the
door for what we'll be showing and when.

As usual, actual titles and showing times may change without notice due to
unforeseen circumstances. Some of the scheduled titles may be replaced at
the last minute by some special surprises!

Anime being shown will be kept to PG-13 throughout the daytime, and shift
towards more mature tastes through the night (sorry, no porn!).

Due to prior experiences with locales that have curfews, BAAS does check
audience members for proof of age from around midnight to about 6:00 am
while the room is open. If you are under 18 (or acting like it) and in the
anime room during this time without your parent or legal guardian being
with you, you will be asked to leave the room. Besides, if you?re under
18, you need your sleep (in a bed) anyways!


4.  Hotel Information

By now, the hotel blocks for Further Confusion 2008 at both the DoubleTree
and Holiday Inn have closed. No further reservations at the con rate are
possible.

However, we can still take requests to manage your existing reservation.
For example, if you'd like to change or add names on a room, transfer your
room to someone else, request a roll-away bed, etc.


5.  Furly Edition

The Furly Edition is our at-con newsletter, and will be printed for each
day of the convention. Furly Edition #0 will be available on the Thursday
of the con. If you have announcements for later printings of Furly
Edition, we will have submission boxes put out at the con. Usually, these
can be found at the Info Desk as well as Convention Operations.


6.  Preliminary Schedule and Important Times

Theres always last minute changes but its pretty well locked down and can
be found here:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2008/schedule>


7.  Art Show

Art show is full. We have about 15 people in the waiting list for some, or
additional panels. We're slowly allocating panels as artist's release
theirs for various reasons. Every applicant should have been contacted by
e-mail by now: If you haven't heard from us, please e-mail us immediately
so we can get you the information you need.

Two important requests: Please e-mail us - at con-time, call - as soon as
you know if you won't be using all your panels, or if you're running late.
Also, please scan and e-mail us your control sheet so we can do pre-con
data entry.

If you'd like to assist ON the art show with us, please drop us a note at
artshow at furtherconfusion.org


8.  Furry Night Live 2008 - Lineup almost full!

FC's Sunday evening stage show features a variety of furry acts performed
live, plus short video segments, with cash prizes decided on audience
ballot. If you are interested in performing a skit in the Sunday evening
stage show, please see the info desk to find
out if the lineup is full. 

For more information or questions, please see the FNL Lead, Yippee, on
Friday from 10:30am to noon at the Events Office (Room #123), or at the
Dress Rehearal on Saturday from 11:30am to 2:00pm on the Main Stage. 

Pre-registered acts can turn in their final paperwork and media at these
times.


9.  Final Staff Meeting

Our next and final staff meeting will be January 19th starting at noon in
the San Jose Doubletree hotel. Come be part of something great, and it's
still not too late to volunteer! Look at any LCD screen for "Further

Who told you that?!

Rule number one about the fursuit list: nobody talks about the  
fursuit list.
Rule number two: if it's your first time here, you gotta suit!

Hello, well its my first time posting here.
I have joined earlier, but i have never get on posting a message.
Actualy never have something to comment about.
But i got a question.
Suddenly i have think...
?Wich its a good way to make "eyes"?
I have always think my eyes (well acctually trought my mask).
Look way to small, so theres no way to make a "glass" or something to look trought the mask, but that will look like an eye from outside.
I have noticed in not very lighted places, visibility its very limitated from inside a mask.
Cheers!

It really depends on what style you want. I've seen some where the white 
part of the eye is plastic (for example: 
http://www.matrices.net/eyes.asp ) and you see only out the black 
pupil.

The other style is to have the entire eye be wire or plastic mesh and 
painted. It gives you more area for air and to see through, but you'll 
probably need a layer of fabric to avoid having your face visible 
through camera flashes. I'm going to be trying this approach, myself.

Lastly, I suppose you could use the lenses from sunglasses, as they're 
designed to be seen through, but this has the drawback of not letting 
any air through.

Hope this helps

Subject: FL: Synthetic Fur Creases
Message-ID: <945737.66812.qm@web52509.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I recently purchased some synthetic fur from the local fabric shop, and when I got it home, I noticed that it had several big creases in it.  (As an aside, I think its acrylic)  I would guess that they are there from it being folded too long in the store.  My question is: will the crease marks come out on their own, or is there anything I can do to get them out?
Thank you for the advice.

I've had fur with creases like that. I made some long sleeved hand  
paws and over time and use (maybe a good 20 times worn and a few  
washes), the creases came out. I've never tried it, but I heard that a  
low temperature steamer can get those out right quick. I'm too scared  
to try it because of the heat part. My sister just got a <a href="https://www.buytobi.com/?&page=order_form&src=affiliate&aid=14435&subid=Main 
">Tobi</a> so I might just test it out on some creased scrap fur. I'll  
let you know how it turns out.

I too have had this problem. First I ironed the back...then with the iron on low, I'd quickly move the iron over the hairs (with grain) and brush right behind it (kinda like two hand brushing a horse)........I'd keep doing this until the crease disappeared.

Yes we use the iron and steam method here. As we buy a lot of furs different
quality and thickness we find ironing with a steam iron is the best and
works super. Just be careful to not get the fur itself hot.

Subject: Re: FL: Synthetic Fur Creases

I've had fur with creases like that. I made some long sleeved hand paws and
over time and use (maybe a good 20 times worn and a few washes), the creases
came out. I've never tried it, but I heard that a low temperature steamer
can get those out right quick. I'm too scared to try it because of the heat
part. My sister just got a <a href="https://www.buytobi.com/?
<https://www.buytobi.com/?&page=order_form&src=affiliate&aid=14435&subid=Mai
n> &page=order_form&src=affiliate&aid=14435&subid=Main">Tobi</a> so I might
just test it out on some creased scrap fur. I'll let you know how it turns
out.

I usually run the shower in the bathroom on hot for a little bit, to build up some steam in there, having the fur draped over a towel hanger, or the curtain rod, and then let it sit for a while. After the fur is warm and damp, I bring it out where it's colder, brush it flat, and let it sit until dry. Works every time for me.

Be very careful with the iron and steamer suggestions when getting faux fur creases and fold marks out. Test on a scrap piece of fur first. Electric Irons are all different - you might cause permanant iron marks if you heat up your faux fur too much. - Be very careful! :) GL!

Can just lay the cloth/fur out flat and put a few towels on top of it the press it flat, then comb it out after a few days. It'll help remove the creases but probably not completely - just wearing the fursuit will make creases come out over time.

It really depends on what style you want. I've seen some where the white 
part of the eye is plastic (for example: 
http://www.matrices.net/eyes.asp ) and you see only out the black 
pupil.

The other style is to have the entire eye be wire or plastic mesh and 
painted. It gives you more area for air and to see through, but you'll 
probably need a layer of fabric to avoid having your face visible 
through camera flashes. I'm going to be trying this approach, myself.

Lastly, I suppose you could use the lenses from sunglasses, as they're 
designed to be seen through, but this has the drawback of not letting 
any air through.

Hope this helps

I too have had this problem. First I ironed the back...then with the iron on low, I'd quickly move the iron over the hairs (with grain) and brush right behind it (kinda like two hand brushing a horse)........I'd keep doing this until the crease disappeared.

Yes we use the iron and steam method here. As we buy a lot of furs different
quality and thickness we find ironing with a steam iron is the best and
works super. Just be careful to not get the fur itself hot.

I can detest to that.  My fox suit, after Kodi finished it, had some
creases in his left leg somehow.  I didn't do anything but just
ignored it and it eventually dissapeared after several wears. :P

Sometimes what I've done is get a castoff fabric roll tube/flat and roll 
it on there. Either that or if needed, hang it from the shower curtain 
rod or other sturdy long rod. This last one works especially well when I 
use crepe hair and I have to get it straightened out by hanging from the 
rod and weighting it.

If you got the space, take a door and put it on something like sawhorses 
and just drape it over the door. Your big dinner table can work also.

*pops head out of bush* Mew? Hello..I am an Arizona
fur and I have made my own head and currently working
on another head at the moment.. If you wish to learn
some methods I can lend a paw :3 I have also been
attending the head construction panels at FC so I will
have some new tricks up my sleave when I return :3 I
will also be starting construction on my own suit so
maybe we can experiment on that one... You can talk
with me on either Aim (SN: SadaNinjaKitty) or Yahoo
(SN SadaAoko )

Subject: FL: Hi,
Message-ID: <479B78B4.2060306@ripnet.com>

I get your e-mail all the time. I am not a fur suit wearer (don't check 
the spelling).
I make them. Some day I hope to have time to make my own. I would love to go
to one of the conventions. I have been making a lot of mascots for schools.
I am trying to find tiger fur. The school gave me a very nice tiger head 
(half a head
that hangs on the wall). I am trying to match the fur. Any I have found 
is very orange.
The head they gave me is more on the gold shade. Can anyone direct me to 
a place
I might find a match, or does anyone have some.
Thanks so much for any help you can give.
Jeannie

I'm a Zonie fur too XD
I've made a couple heads for myself and my sister (and her friend...) but I'm still no expert.  I'd be glad to lend a hand if you need it as well.

 From the look of the picture, its an impeller rather than
a fan, which is probably a good thing.  Typically they move
less air, but at higher pressure, which means it could force
air around the inside of the suit even where there isn't much
room for airflow.

Of course there's nothing to stop you just buying your own
(though they are not nearly as common as fans) or salvaging
one from a dead graphics card perhaps.

I have contacted them for more information and to see if I can try one. As
we are in Canada it should be easy for us to have one and give it a try out.
I will keep you posted.

Hi every one, I hate to ask and I'm thinking about making my own fursuit and
was wondering if any one here can tell me where I could find a wolf pattern
and some good fur to make a fursuit? I am new to fursuit making, and this
will be my first go at it. I will appreciate any information you can give
me. Thank you.

Well, the design does make soem asumptions about the costume design, that 
may work fien for the bigger "mascot style" costumes liek the relms heads 
and such, but the newer smaller, tighter fitting 'furry style" mascots, 
probably wouldn't receive as much benefit (or be as needed in the first 
place)  so it may work in certain situatiosn but nto for the majority fo the 
curent gen cotumes out there, anythign that has muzzle ventalation wouldn't 
require an "air exchanger"

also last tiem i checked, the airplane blowers were hardly "noiseless"

I would suggest looking at the FAQ part of fursuit.org web site. There is a
great amount of info there for making fursuits.

What? Someone selling a fan? But those are for mascots! People with 
their fancy-pants professional foam carvers and fleece skins and 
custom-made baseball jerseys not bought at Big and Tall shops!

We answer to a higher calling! Where we make our own stuff, just like 
MacGuyver would! Well, except that we don't disarm bombs with paperclips 
and he never posed as a fox except for that one episode.

WE are artists, who draw our materials from crafts stores, Radio Shack, 
Kragens, and Home Depot! Dare to create! Buy a computer fan instead, and 
let it run at half speed on 6V, and you can do it for less than $20, 
much cheaper than that flash-laden site demands.

Sure, you can buy that fan, custom made for one brand of mascot costume 
where it can advertise 200% more oxygen and a minty flavor, but not I, 
good sir, not I!

Good day, and good night!

Nah. They're bulky, only keep you cool for a short while, and make a 
huge farting noise as they blow air.

The obvious solution would be to hold conventions in wind tunnels. Then 
we could also test how well the bird costumes can fly.

Seriously, though, I am curious as to what Karen finds out about them, 
but with the big claims thrown about, I'm tempted to say the homemade 
fan will be a better bang for the buck.

Thats what I thought it was going to be before I saw the web site. When I
saw it was just a fan I blew it off.

Hmm... Don't you think wearing just a Speedo in suit is a bit... wrong?

You know, I thought about that, and it could be doable, but you've got a 
few obstacles:

On earth and not in freefall, underwater, or on the moon, the equipment 
can get really heavy, especially with the pumps and batteries. It might 
keep you cool, but more fatiqued.

Without a space pack, you'll need some way to vent the heat. That 
actually might be neat with a semimechanical creature. But you might be 
better off just using direct ventilation, then.

However, if you do liquid cool your suit, you do get a few benefits, 
like overclocking your tail.

Whew. Glad I'm not the only one spooked by that. And his expression. And 
what's that supposed to be? Part bear, part gerbil, part gremlin? A 
begerlin?

The dangers of too much oxygen.

hmm shows how little i know tech specs that way :\

i thought it would work through some sorta natrual convection on a smaller
scale :\

yeah that was a HUGE suit O.o how dose the wideth fit through doors in that
diagram?

and i've worn boxers under suit before, but really it was just lounging
'round watching tv and some crud like that so it wasn't like i was paraiding
around going "and what they don't know is....."

Oh and I though it was  Pig

I've never had a suit with a fan, I dotn really see the point if the head is 
designed well, and in teh stlye I liek, over heating (atleast in the head) 
isn't an issue

then again fan or nto I'm not doign a 4 mile parade in the middle of July

There are cooling suits that dont weight much at all. There are people that
have been born with out sweet glands. They have cooling suits for them so
they can survive. I have no idea what they cost but there out there.

I have never warn anything under my fursuits. I saw it as a way to keep
cooler. No insulation keeping the heat in or the airflow out.

Counter-intuitive though it may seem at first, an undersuit of spandex works
well at cutting the heat.  The theory is that the closer-fitting the suit is
(and this follows for an undergarment), the less chance heat has to
convect.  I have never used a fan or any type of cooling system in my suits,
though mine are mostly closer-fitting.

Mascots. Really worth a look.

There's some pretty creative balloon art suits/costumes here in this 
website. Combine a little fur with a bit of balloon art and makeup...

It's pretty easy to do this sort of thing, but damn... There's a good bit 
of creativity here, even though a lot of it is only temporary. Looks like 
someone's gotta watch out for the hot lights and sharp objects.

LOL. Thank you - I probably am feeling that lazy, but I still need to  make 
the suit myself as it has to be out of butterscotch colored fur and they  just 
don't have one like that! 
 
Thank you to felinius tigerclaw for the kwiksew pattern number  - I  think I 
can adapt that for my son much more easily than making my own so  I've just 
ordered one.
 
Thanks to both of you for responding -

Wild, all right! I had recently come across the site, and thought of the 
list. One pic shows three guys, one with feline makeup, the other with 
reptilian and the other with something else. The girl that did a balloon 
butterfly, now that was nice! Now, think of someone doing a dragon. This 
kind of thing will take a lot of planning on how you'll do the mix of fur, 
balloon art, maybe makeup and facial appliances, and other things.

ooh.. Think of the possibilities! It's research time!

I've never done balloon art, but it's easily picked up with practice.

I'd guess one of those balloon dresses took maybe a couple hours to do. 
Now the hats, maybe 5 minutes in the case of the three guys. You noticed 
many of them wore a unitard underneath, since the balloon latex may cause 
some itching on unprotected skin.

Back around Anthrocon 2000, I think, though I forget what year, we 
'invaded' a restaurant with 2-3 of us in makeup/suit. We had a balloon guy 
come in and make us interconnected balloon hats. Think about it... A line 
of at least 15-20 people walking in the mall where the restaurant was, all 
connected by balloon hats connected to each other. It was wild.

Unfortunately, I somehow misloaded the film in my manual camera, dangit! 
Otherwise I'd have had some great shots.

I am looking to wear something under my suit so that I can not sweat into
the fur of my suit.  Does anyfur have an idea of what I should use for the
material?
I've gotten suggestions for using something like a scuba suit, and someone
else suggested using something from the maker Under Armour.

I've only ever owned one suit, and from my experience, I would say, wear as little as possible. 

At most, I would say wear a pair of shorts, and a light t-shirt, so you cover the major sweat producing areas of the body: The crotch, the chest and the armpits. That way you will minimise the amount of sweat that seeps into the suit, but you won't overheat yourself!!

hey foxwolf9!

i subscribe to the under armor style -got the long sleeve and shorts - 
down past the shorts i wear long cotton tube socks and some fabric  
soccer knee pads, simply to cover as much as possible.  I've had luck  
with the under armor as it keeps me cool enough that i don't sweat as  
much.  My neck, hands and calves sweat the most since the under armor  
does not cover there.  I have a feeling Scape is hotter than most due  
to being made almost exclusively of extra long pile fur.  Anyways,  
try a few different styles and find what works -but you'll most  
likely sweat some no matter what you wear lol

Oh, I'm prepared to sweat, but I want to be able to keep as much sweat out
of the fur and in the under clothing, what ever type it is.

I wear a set of surgical scrubs sometimes.
Easy to use. Packs in a small size. Lightweight.
Cheap to get. Washes out easily. Absorbs a lot of sweat.
Something I learned from other on the list. =)

They look cool, but a quick look at the data sheet shows extremely low
speed. The best I could find was 7mm/s (SQL1.8.6). That is way too slow for
animatronics. Considering 1cm travel for a blink, that would be a 3 second
blink (1cm down and back). 

 

Also, the larger SQ-100N series has an upper end of 40degC. That's 104degF.
And considering a starting point of 98.6, 104deg is very conceivable in a
suit.

 

Tho I am impressed with the .5micrometer accuracy on them. That's pretty
fine control, but I'll keep my servos for now.

I wear a Lycra Suit.
You can get it cheap from Scuba.com.
http://www.scuba.com/scuba-gear-44/Dive-Skins.html
Sadly they raised the price from $39.99, but still a good deal.
Covers your whol body, it's really thin so it doesn't make you any hotter
under your suit, and it dries incredibly fast.
Just wash it out in the sink, and let it hang dry. After a long night of
dancing and sweating, it'll be dry in the morning and smelling fresh :)

Ok first off, HI SCAPE!!!!  I forgot you were on this list :p

Second, I know its a bit off topic, But for cooling purposes, is it worth it
to worry about icepacks?  Please understand that the closest i've ever come
to suiting was being the easter bunny at an easter egg hunt(sad for me) and
that wasn't terribly hot. (although it certainly wasn't cold)

Wow impressive!  Good job on the math.  Do you think it would have enough
torque to work an animatronic tail?

Idea to throw out: How about an eyelid mechanism that uses both servos and
a solenoid? The servo for the slower eyelid motions, the solenoid for the
blink?   Rig it to where the servo would control the majority of the
motion, but then the solenoid can temporarily override the current
position and cause a blinking action that'll just return to the last
position the servo was at...

if anything i agree with the person who suggested  under armor its breathable and will help aid in stopping sweat from coming in contact with your fur suit and also help so your skin aint bothered or chaffed by the suit aswell so best bet is find under armor *dicks sporting goods, sports authority etc* or something similar made of nylon hope this helps! *wags tail* ^^

I wear a tshirt, underwear with swimming trucks and socks.  That seems to be just fine for at least 4 hours of suit time.

Just a little note on Under Armour (which is fantastic stuff)...  Make 
sure you buy the HeatGear line, rather than the ColdGear one.  One is 
made to keep you cool in hot weather, the other is made to keep you warm 
in cold weather.  Wearing the wrong one under a fursuit will bring a 
quick end to your fursuit outing.

-Uck!

The best stuff you can wear for under-fursuit wear is spandex.  It's not 
only the world's greatest fabric, it's the pinnacle of human innovation!
The great thing about spandex under your fursuit is that it distributes 
the moisture and wicks it away, without getting it into your fursuit. 
Spandex is much more easily washable than your fursuit!

My personal picks for undersuit spandex are Under Armor, Eastbay lycra

(http://www.eastbay.com/catalog/advancedSearch/?module=topNav&action=keywordSearch&search=k&keyword=Eastbay+Lycra 
) 
and Easton spandex (www.easton.com).

The best part about wearing spandex under your fursuit is-- if you have to 
save the world, you're already in your spandex superhero costume!

I'll add my thumbs up to wearing lycra dive skins under suit.  I've
been wearing them for about a couple of years now.  Before then, it
was a t-shirt and shorts.  But I would have to pack several shirts to
make it throughout the weekend.  A lycra dive skin, you only need one
or two to make it through the weekend.  Easy to pack, easy to wash and
dry, much cooler under suit.

Hummmmmm ^^;;.... Zest Raccoon here (coon suiter)
 
*Long time reader first time poster*
 
I would not really suggest scuba suit as when I searched for clothes for under my suit I actually went to a very specialize scuba suit center in Ottawa (Canada capital).
 
And I told the situation and she told me I would boil to death O.o... 
 
As the suit my let the sweat out but what is never really told is most keep the heat IN! The Licra suit.
 
But what I use and never have any problem what so ever are the suits that the people that do professional cyclist use.
 
Its light, keep the sweat from touching the suit AND keep the heat OUT!
 
But that?s my opinion ^^;;...
 
*Best suggestions* Try many things and see what is best and more comfy for ya ;)

Hands down Underarmor Heat tight gear is the best
thing ever to wear under the suit... So much so that
our mascot team has been required to wear it under
their suits for a couple of years...

It's tight fitting, deals with the sweat, and, makes
wearing the suit very comfortable.  Plus, you don't
have to worry with the potential "wedgy" factor that
we found with boxer style pants.  Or, for that matter
the suit going up or down on you.

Downside, it's expensive, and, if you do an all day
appearance where you know you're going to be out of
the suit for some time, you're going to want a second
set as it doesn't always dry... And it's gross putting
on wet underarmor (that's from experience)

But, wouldn't trade it for anything in the world... I
now use it under my sporting gear (hockey, workout,
etc) as a base layer.

Oh, and, they also make a head cap that's ideal for
keeping longer hair out of your eyes during a set.

Our team have the option to use either a balaclava on
their heads, or, the UA head piece...

UA ROCKS!  Cotton is the enemy!

Lycra dive skins are very cool and do not trap hat, it's not a scuba suit it's a dive skin to wear UNDER the scuba suit ussually a lucra / nylon blend, in fact it assists in coolign whenever there is air flow.

Ice packs are bad, first off they are too cold and can actually hurt your skin and be unhealthy, beyond that you're adding in a ton of weight, and once they stop providing cooling, all they do is make you hotter, and trap sweat.  It's also uncomfortable to be huged wearing ice packs, limits your mobility and what you can do in suit like lay down and get scritched, or do inflateable mazes, etc.  not worth it.  Plus it wont fit onder suits that are propelry fitted to you and.or look bulgy and weird

  Second, I know its a bit off topic, But for cooling purposes, is it worth it to worry about icepacks?  Please understand that the closest i've ever come to suiting was being the easter bunny at an easter egg hunt(sad for me) and that wasn't terribly hot. (although it certainly wasn't cold)

I suspect I'll wear two spandex unitards for my own spandex fursuit pretty
soon since I just replaced my old Hot Pink one.  I found NY Dancewear to
make a good product.  I wonder what other folks think of them.
And yes, I totally agree with Super Jayhawk about the awesome-osity of
spandex.

That is why you need GlacierTek
(www.coolvest.com).  The freezing point is much higher, so it doesn't  
freeze your skin like ice.  Not only do I wear the cool vest, I also  
wear the packs on my forearms and shins, where I produce the most  
heat.  They last up to 2 hours, and solidify in 20 minutes in ice  
warer.  I've been using them for 5 years and will not suit without them.

Lycra/Spandex suits under my fursuit make me too hot, but I do wear a  
t-shirt made of similar material, designed to keep you cool, and bike  
shorts.  You need to experiment and find what works best for you.

True, they will not fit in a form-fitting suit.  But there are cooling  
neck collars.

I had a little extra room in scape that i planned on filling out with  
foam but my cool vest took care of that -so i'm the perfect shape,  
plus nice and cool! lol but yeah cool vests are better than ice packs  
-i even let my cool vest "warm up" to it's natural temp (steady 58  
degrees) since it numbs me if i put it on straight out of the freezer.

Another vote here for using a cool vest (which uses phase change
material to sit at 18 centigrade - pleasantly cool), but with the
caveat that you need to be aware of the 2 hour limit and plan
accordingly.  Easy to recharge in less than 20 mins with a bucket
of ice from a hotel vending area.  The pouches are soft and flexible,
and don't have any issues that Antimon described.

Got mine from http://www.texascoolvest.com/

I use Lowe Alpine Dryflo undergarments, primarily because I'm
familiar with them and they are readily available from the local
outdoor shop.

They have might barely have the torque but not the speed or the travel. 

 

5 Newtons of force is what they claim with a stall strength of a little
higher, but for a tail I wouldn't recommend anything under 42oz/in (or
roughly 3x that strong). I use 60oz/in min personally.

 

Speed wise; 7mm/s vs the average servo of .2s/60deg. Using WolfTronix's
(www.wolftronix.com) 2" pulleys, that's about 1" of travel in .2s (or
roughly 4 times the travel in 1/5th the time). The squiggle would give a
very slow motion.

 

And travel, using 90deg deflection for servo movement with full travel of
180degrees on a 2" pulley, that's 3" of total travel. The squiggle motors
top out around 30mm of travel or about 2/5 the travel. So not only would it
be a slow motion, it wouldn't be particularly far motion.

 

They are pretty strong for their size, but are overall too weak, slow, and
short for tails. Perhaps for some facial control (snarl or eyebrows) they
would work, but for general purpose animatronics. no go IMHO.

Add another vote for under-armor. They also make heatguard shirts and 
shorts that'll pass for street clothes, which is what I use most often.

The logic for this as opposed to cotton is that it doesn't trap the 
moisture in but wicks it away. That way, the evaporation can work 
better, keeping you cooler, and thus, making you sweat less.

Mind you, this doesn't work as well if you're ill with a fever.

Sounds nice, but doesn't that mean it transfers the sweat directly to 
your suit, so the effect would be the same as if you'd sweat into your suit?
One of my reasons for wearing under suit wear is to keep the sweat away 
from the suit to prevet ist from becoming it smelly without having to 
wash it very often.

The sweat is dispersed over a larger area and evaporates almost  
instantly.  The resulting water vapor readily passes through outer  
layers, exchanged with dry air through regular movement.  Sweat has  
less opportunity to "pool up" in problem areas and cause a funk.

Under Armour and the like have a secondary benefit of simply being  
more comfortable for extended use, empirically demonstrated if you've  
ever, say, tried bicycling any considerable distance on a hot day  
while wearing cotton underwear.  Those areas of the body most prone to  
heavy perspiration also have some of the most tender skin, and sweat- 
saturated cotton rubbing against such spots can cause chafing or even  
a painful and persistent rash.

The issue is sweating is a given, unless you've got insane cooling or 
it's only for very short durations. But if you hold it all in, the sweat 
will cling to your skin, reducing your body's ability to keep cool, 
causing you to sweat more, and keeping the sweat around to get funky.

Yes, some sweat will get to the suit. But don't forget you've also got a 
layer of air in there. If it's in a form that spreads the surface area, 
it'll evaporate instead of going to the suit. Not only that, but it'll 
keep you cool, and that will cause less sweat to the suit than if you 
tried to hold it in. I haven't tested it, but the belief is that 
underarmor evaporates the sweat better than skin does.

If nothing else, take it from someone's whose gone from tee-shirt and 
shorts to fancy-pants underarmor.

If you're still concerned, add in fans or ventilation to keep you from 
needing to sweat so much in the first place. For the record, I know that 
Moffet Field doesn't use their 80 by 120 foot wind tunnel anymore, and 
it's only 15 minutes off of 101 from where FC's held.

Repeat after me: Fabreeze and lysol, the suit inside out to dry each day 
of use, and hand washing after a few days of heavy use when you can 
afford to hang it up to dry for a day or two. They WILL need it, for no 
other reason than that you also have to address smells that don't come 
from you. Either that, or post signs, "You must be *this* odor-free to 
hug the fuzzy thing."

The reason why we sweat is to cool off, as air moving against moisture cools 
better then air moving across dry skin.  But what the udner suit does is 
distripute that moister and prevent the drip drip onto the suit it also 
prevents pockets of heavier moister from forming.  On top of that it acts 
like a filter, keeping oils or dirt on the inside of the undersuit enstead 
of on your fur backing, so even if the suit gets wet, it doeesn't get 
anywhere near as wet overall, it's more evenly wet and it's a cleaner wet.

Did we mention the suit is 1000x easier to take off when you have something 
smooth and silky then sticky sweaty skin or cotton

Ewwwww fan boi stink.....I hate when smelly people hug me....
Generlaly i wash my suits every 4 or 5 events, and i spray them down after 
every event once I get home, not so much during the con.  I'm not all that 
active in suit the majoority of the time though.  Perfering to lay in a 
corner and cuddle

mmm wind tunnel, can we get the bird suits to fly?

Hello all!
  Quick question for all of you adults above 20 years old if yall dont 
mind (Basically for those humans whom have stopped growing):

What is the circumference of your head, from the front of the forehead 
around the tips of the ears to the back of the head?

I'm trying to get a general average of headsize for the projects I'm 
working on: I've found that my own noggin is on the "XL" side of things, 
with my circumference being 24.5", whereas my GF has a circumference of 
22", and I'm not certain if thats small or not.

To prevent bombardment of the list, please send responses to 
stego at cpl.net. For the benefit of others, I will post the results here 
in summary form if I get enough responses.

I can't help with pattern info, but I recommend
 
_www.montereymills.com_ (http://www.montereymills.com) 
 
as a resource for the fur. I bought an entire roll (about 13 yards) of  their 
butterscotch colored pile last year and have enough for a second costume.  
Click on  "Our Catalogue" at the top of the home page. Good luck!

  and the best fur for a wolf suit is long pile fur cause it makes it look more realistic but it depends on your preferances ^__^ hope this helps!

Hi everyone,

I was asked by a friend of mine about Realms of Enchantment (also known as 
Darkstone Realms) who mailed some fabric for a custom jaguar fursuit.
Apparently he's having trouble getting ahold of them and their website is 
down.  Does anyone have any updated contact info for Realms of Enchantment 
or have info as to their status?

 								Thanks!

trustable and relyable business relationship.

Mail does not work anymore.

I have had dealings with them years ago and I was quite happy with them.
What might have happened was that they went out of business. It does happen.

Yea and they spend months collecting people's cash before they file for bankruptcy too.  I won't say that's what happened here, just that I've seen it happen before.

Sorry, never introduced myself on a whole to the group.  Name's Binx, arctic fox staying on the east coast.  Good to meet you all.  n.n

Does anyone know if Lacy is on this list?  I've made a payment to her about a month and a half ago for some new fursuit parts and I can't get a reply to save my life.  It always makes me nervous when a "merchant" doesn't reply after the $500 has been sent.  She even solicited me the work at MFF and I made the payment around mid December.  I wouldn't think this would happen with her since she is somewhat well known with fursuits and seems to be cranking them out still.  I know for a fursuit maker, it must be tough having to deal with a million impatient customers wanting to know everyday how their suit is coming along, but I just want some acknowledgment that the payment is received, and that the work will begin on X date and will be ready around X date.  There is still a minimal amount of communication that must still happen, even if you are sick of talking to people, if that is the case.

I was having problems contacting another fursuit maker as well but they were
just swamped with suit work and my emails got lost in the shuffle.  I'd say
try contacting them by IM, PM on a forum/site they frequent, or something
like that, you'd probably have better luck. :)

About the Lacy thing, I hope y'all weren't taken by
that person who was pretending to be Lacy a while
back. If you know for sure it was Lacy you talked to,
ignore this message. :)

Hi Folks

I hope it workout well at least but i lost hope in case of Darkstone.
The money is already for me written down as lost money.
More angry about that is that i lost a premier NFL customer with that.

No response of fursuitmakers:
We I'm one too - some times you have so much to do you hardly can response the
mail. This is not a excuse for that. But at least after 2-3 weeks a response
should be done for the customer.
But some Fursuitmakers do too many commissions in row and so they get lost if
something happens such like a sickness, personal problems .......
After making 9 years fursuits and mascot costume i been to the calculation of 1
costume in 4 weeks it worked out it is a amount which is to keep in hands as single
working person in a business.
But still some costumes in row more then i want sometimes. To get the customer
without worries about his money I installed a Lancam in my Workshop so he gets a password and can
watch the process.

Money:
I heard a lot of time that people been ripped of in case of money from
fursuitmakers. Well i can't do my hands in that.
In my case i do a different way of cashing a customer.
Usually i charge the people a be in row money which is 100 Euro or if we meet on a
con he invites me to a Dinner.
Payment for the suit is then happen when i actually start with the suit. Then is
the payment 50% straight up.
But the money goes on a straight on a bank account to park it. Until the suit is
complete done. Last payment is  when the suit is collected or if the customer
agreed, when i start the other 50% of the suit, to pay the rest.
This system worked out good so far for me.

In general to let make a suit is a lot of money for someone. So i just fair for me
to give him some security about is money back or ?
As Scape said we are furries and usually we should keep together and not doing that
money shit and rip a other fur of her hard earned money.
Furs who do such things have not a good stand with me personal !!!!!

So have a nice weekend

Atalon the Deer

Oh I'm sure it was Lacy I sent the money to.  The money on PayPal should go to Amber Barnett.  This freaked me out when I bought my first Lacy suit which was delivered as promised.  That's where my money went this time too.

Having read through the e-mails, it seems that several people recommend Under Armour.  Under Armour is polyester/nylon-spandex.  What I wonder is if a cotton-spandex might be more effective.

I've used both.  The major advantage I've seen for Under Armour vs 
cotton-spandex is that it's really quick to dry.  You can wash it out 
thorougly, hang it to dry, and it's good to go surprisingly quickly.  
Comes in handy at conventions when you plan on 'suiting several times a day.

But cotton-lycra would be my second choice, if Under Armour didn't exist.

8 total yards of fur is waaaaay overboard, if you ask me. Honestly I think you could do that with 1-1 1/2 yards of black, and 2-3 yards of grey. At the MOST.

Ok, so I was a bit over enthusiastic in saying you needed 5.5 yards of the
gray, but I'd not go with less than 3.5 yards of the gray, and 1.5 yards of
the black at the least.

Here's something on the fursuit FAQ that'll answer your question;


Assuming the material is of a 60" width on the roll or folded on the bolt 
(one yard is .9144 metres, one inch is 2.54 centimetres); 

Head - Depending on the head size, around 1-2 yards. 
Body - Allowing for some trimming to be done, 2-3 yards. Lots of padding, 
add an extra 1-2 yards. 
Tail - Some tails are huge, most are small. Most will require up to one 
yard. Large oversize skunk tails can use 2 yards. 
Forepaws/hands - Up to one yard. 
Hindpaws/feet - Up to one yard. 
Wings - How big is your wingspan? Are you going to use fur? You may need 
2-5 yards of fabric. Think about what other materials you may use. 

For shorter widths, you may need more fabric. 

How much is that doggie in the window? Seriously, add up all projected 
costs of doing the costume. If you can't afford to do it right now, then 
start stockpiling the stuff you need over time, then build. The suit can 
wait. Your bills and rent can't. 

Most people go for around 6-8 yards which is more than enough and allows 
for extras and suit repairs. Ordering a 15 yard roll of Monterey Mills fur 
is not uncommon. You can sell off the excess fur or use it for another 
suit. 


From: Damian K 
Subject: RE: FL: How much Fur? 

I can't say exactly I kind of go by instinct and in head metacalculations 
but here's the main factors: 

Most sellers will only cut as short as a half yard, If your making an all 
white suit with a six inch black tail you'll still have to take half a 
yard, keep this in mind. 

Whatever your height is plus half a yard to start. 

Do you have a pattern, either on paper or a very well thought out mental 
plan? How you arrange the cuts will affect the efficiency in parts per 
yard of fabric. No patterns, add another half yard 

If you make a test fit out cheap cloth you'll know exactly how much fabric 
you'll need and forego this guesswork. How experienced are you, depending 
on your confidence in yourself add between zero to one yards. 

If the heads oversized add between 1/2 to 1 yard. 

If the body's exeptionally large and overstuffed add 75 to 100% to the 
last number. 

If the cloth's on a 45 inch wide roll add another 75 to 100%. 

This is of course assuming you're buying one type/color of fabric. 

Round up to the nearest half yard and you should have a bit more than you 
need. That's okay, you'll eventually wear a spot out or desire an upgrade 
to some part of your suit and it'll come in handy.

We're about the same in height. What Niiku said was good. It helps to have 
extras like it said above. Seems some of us still haven't quite used up 
our Monterey Mills fur bolts. When putting your pattern to the fur, make 
sure you can make it all fit properly on there.

Measure twice, cut once.

I nearly cut one time until I checked the lay of the fur, finding it was 
facing upwards rather than downwards...

My best guess is maybe a yard for the black, and perhaps up to 3 for the
gray. I'd buy 2 yards of black and 4 of the gray though. You'll likely have
a fair amount left over, but that's better than running out and discovering
that you can't buy the same fur later. This will allow for mistakes during
construction, and for repairs in the future. I am assuming standard 55- to
60-inch wide fur, which is most common. If desired, any extra fur scraps
can be sold on FurBid.

Subject: FL:  Nonstretch NFT Fur
Message-ID: <8064773.1204210547794.JavaMail.root@elwamui-huard.atl.sa.earthlink.net>

I am looking at several fur options for a bodysuit.  One under consideration is NFT fur.  If I do go with NFT, I am considering their nonstretch fur.  Past experience has showed me that the spandex in their 4-way stretch fur tends to split and come apart and needs constant maintenance.

I was wondering if anybody here has had any experience with the nonstretch variety of NFT fur.  How amendable is their backing to sewing a bodysuit?  Is it heavier than the backing on the Monteray Mills fox fur for example?  Will the nonstretch NFT fur go through a serger like the Monteray Mills does?

Another question is have any of you constructed a fursuit head with NFT fur?

The normal (nonstretch) NFT fur backing is stronger than the 4-way, but 
isn't quite as strong as MM fur. It does still want to unravel and fray 
at the edges, but not as much as the 4-way. It does hold thread better 
than the normal 4-way stuff, but I haven't tried a serger on it.

NFT also has (had?) a heavier 4-way stretch backing that we've used on 
animatronics. It holds up much, much better than the normal 4-way, but 
you wouldn't want much of it on a suit as it breathes about as well as a 
sheet of rubber.

They also have a lightweight "lace" backing that is amazingly fragile.

We've used it on heads, but we're mostly building on top of a solid 
latex base.

  Name: Loop Furwalker
   
  Age: (wolf teenager ---- about the same age as a human)
   
  Height: 6 ft  9 inches
   
  Weight: 219 lbs
   
  Clothing: Likes to where modern styles or mythical outfits, or nothing at all when alone or with his many girlfriends......etc....(other styles will be listed later on, if I can figure them out!!)
   
  Backgrounds: 
   
  Loop lives in two places: (1) A big city apartment complex (mostly animals and furries, but there are some humans living nearby-----off in the distance), (2) A country home of his on devising: looks like a large southern plantation (like Gone With The Wind and/or Song Of  The South ------ same types of settings)
   
  I'll give you more information later ---- when I get the chance to..........
   
  Hope to see you sometime!!

Are your aware that this is a fursuit list, and not a furry list? It's
mainly used for fursuit construction and performance advice, as well as
some other fursuit-related topics. Many members here don't even claim to be
furry. Your posts seem like they might generate a more useful response in a
furry role-playing list.  :)

Here's my latest "gig":
   
  My character is a large male wolf (gray for now ---- no specific colors for now --- still workning on it.....etc...)
   
  The fur is wavy and bushy like it hasen't been brushed or groomed in months.
   
  The eyes and all the facial features are big (like the big-bad-wolf's)
   
  Body is muscular, but not to shapely (like the first bunch of workouts......etc....)
   
  Paws and claws are big and sharp (for the pictures / and/or costume desisns....etc...)
   
  Feet are typically big too (just like a wolf's)
   
  Tail and rump are big at the back (and the legs are long)
   
  Clothing styles: (for now) ------- completely naked or something from the 1970's
   
  Big rim glasses
   
  vest with frilled shirt
   
  pants (if any)
   
  platform shoes
   
  (jewelry and rings too ----- just on the fingers and neck so far)
   
  I don't have a name for him yet ---- I'm still working on it right now
   
  ***** more later ***** when you reply to me ------ thanks if you do
   
  Later..........

Hey loop, this list is really for Fursuit construction and performance.  If you tell me what area you live, I can probably direct you to a good forum or mailing list that you may be looking for.

I edited your subject line because it broke my email.

Are you really asking for a complete list of all fursuits in existence  
by species?

Hi everyone,

Believe it or not, for the first time since 2003 I'm going to actually fly 
to a con again.  I said "never again" nearly five years ago after the 
luggage muncher machine at O'Hare crushed my Action-packer fursuit box 
both going there and coming back home, as well as the TSA being unkind to 
my fursuit.  So while I plan to fly, I'm not trusting my fursuit to the 
airlines or the TSA, especially my new one.

So first question-- what shipping companies are good for shipping a large 
oversized fursuit box across the country?  And can you get them to pick up 
from the hotel?  I would need to insure it for the full cost of the 
costume, at least.  Any preferences or experience on this one?

Also does anyone have any good companies that sell road cases that can 
stand up to the abuse of travel and protect a fursuit?  Rubbermaid doesn't 
make Action Packer containers that fit the dimensions of my new suit 
(especially with the new wings) so I'd like to ask if anyone knows of good 
places that sell road cases or other shipping-level containers in 
different sizes.  Thanks for any info you may have!

Howdy!

Not sure about optimal choice of shippers.  However, Seriously Fucking  
Heavy Duty road cases turn up all the time at the likes of Weird  
Stuff, Excess Solutions, etc.  (Unfortunately they're also Seriously  
Fucking Heavy.  But usually have wheels.)  Depending on the size you  
need, there may be a suitable Pelican case (Seriously Fucking  
Expensive).

About how big would you need for the suit in question?

It depends on the maker anywhere from $900-$3000 depending on options and such.

budget around $2000 and discuss price with the person you are comisioning.  You'll probably get it for less from half the makers, and maybe a little more from the other half.

  From J2 AKA ^FOX TAILS^ : Hey I finally found the website that sells the style fursuits that I like...however, it seams that they are booked in orders all the way until next year :( . So because of that, thier pricing page has been temporarily blocked. Does anybody know what is the average cost to buy a suit from these suit makers? I really really want to have my Fox suit made, and I will probably have the $$$ for it since I am getting a rather large tax refund soon :) . 



  this is a picture-design I drew posted on my Flickr....check it out if you'd like...

That's seriously effin alright.

I suppose luggage wear depends on the airlines. I had only minor damage 
with Alaska Airlines and they didn't even charge for bulk. 
Unfortunately, they're west-coast only. When I went to MFF, I shipped 
the costume to a friend who was local to the area in - no kidding - a 
standard cardboard moving box via USPS, and it arrived no problem. I 
used the soft body, gloves, and clothes to cushion the head in the 
middle of the box.

If shipping, you'll probably not be paying for weight as much as "Bulk 
weight," which is simply, "This box is so big, we're gonna charge you by 
volume." So when I ship next time, I'm going to see about using a 
smaller box and pack more compactly. Perhaps fly with the hands and feet 
with me, and only ship the more fragile bits.

I've never shipped to a hotel, but my concern would be how long they 
would hold onto it before you show up. If you ship with a long ship 
time, it's cheaper but there's the risk it'll show up way too early. And 
if you ship for a faster delivery time, it quickly becomes prohibitively 
expensive. I also keep imagining the poor hotel staff being innundated 
with large, bulky boxes.

And yes, of course, insurance is vital. Because the memories and times 
makes a costume priceless. But when they ask for value, put your pinky 
up to your mouth and say, "A billion dollars!" It never gets old.

With the exception of the time when they lost my suit for 24 hours, I've 
never had an issue with airlines giving my suits excessive abuse, sure the 
action packers get scratched up or their corners based in, but that is why I 
use them, the case takes the abuse the suits come out undamaged.  The only 
thing that sucked is ti was poorign rain on my way to MFF and my suits got 
wet cus they packer was so over stuffed that the lid wasn't makign a solid 
seal and soem fo my air brushign ran plus the suits got a lil damp.  but 
nothign too severe.

As much as I'm paying for a ticket to a con, I want the airlines to take 
care of my luggage, I have issues paying for a ticket THEN spending $50 plus 
to ship my  suits on top of it... Airlines would have to give me a discount 
for not checkign any bags for me to consdier that option, oplus i perfer not 
havign the suits out of my location longer then I have to, having it go on 
an airplane with me, and only being apart for a few ghours makes me much 
more comfortabel then not seeing it for 3-5 days PLUS I dont like leaving 
them packed up for that long as tightly as I pack them. nor do I really want 
them to get that much more funky on the return trip.

My 24 gal action packers 2 gets me 2-4 suits to a con dependign on the 
suits, and it doesn't cost me any extra, though if more airlines adopt the ` 
bag per custoerm rule, I may have to rethink that.

You can brign bigger bags with Hocky bags and soft sidded luggage but I wont 
trust my suits to them the way bags are handled.

I was pretty sure thats who you were interested in, and my advice still stands as far as pricing.  They will give you an actual quote once you send in your concept art, their prices may change between now and then thats why they aren't posted to the website I believe.  Yes they do moving jaws, and air brushing and body paddign and pretty much anythign you could want.  You need the 30% (I think) when your commision is accepted.  to be safe I'd say have atleast 700 to put down if you're planing a lot of bells and whistles

I have 3 suits soon to be 4 from them, excelent builders, unsurpassed customer service

Subject: FL: Chinese made fursuits
Message-ID: <BAY121-W246000413BEFDC3218446ED0110@phx.gbl>


Has anyone here purchased a costume directly from China (ie the cheap ones on EBay with $80- shipping)?
 
I currently have a Chinese made tiger suit that another fur was dissatsified with (they got it on ebay and re-sold it to me) it looks ok but it does need a little work.  
 
I am looking into possibly picking up a stock costume that looks decent for a low price (would like another suit but can't really afford a custom one at the moment).  
 
Before I take the Chinese option off the table I was wondering if anyone had a decent experience with one?
 
Thanks/Snugs

Well I bought one too, while not being dissastified by it (you can't beat the price)... irt required a litlle work....

I have of of the fox like one, the tail didn't please me at all but I am reworking it ... and the feet part where mostly shoe covers 
I am working on those too ....

But I'd say for anyone who doesn't have the time and money to make or buy a custom one ; they are a viable alternative

> My 24 gal action packers 2 gets me 2-4 suits

Part of it was that I've got a Marylen's, which is more in the 
fluffy/padded/big/bulky/mascot spectrum of things, especially the huge 
head, and needed something more like a 55 gallon thing. With less bulky 
suits, yah, some of my advice doesn't apply.

>  The only thing that sucked is it was poorign rain on my way to MFF and 
> my suits got wet cus...

The other thing I forgot to mention was to put all the parts in large 
garbage bags, preferably clear. Specifically, two bags, one facing 
front, the other facing rear, with lots of overlap.

Not only does it protect against some moisture and smells (Imagine if 
the fabreeze bottle broke!), but it forms a weak seal. So then you can 
hand-work out the air and effectively vacuum-pack it, reducing a lot of 
bulk before they go in.

I was pretty sure thats who you were interested in, and my advice still stands as far as pricing.  They will give you an actual quote once you send in your concept art, their prices may change between now and then thats why they aren't posted to the website I believe.  Yes they do moving jaws, and air brushing and body paddign and pretty much anythign you could want.  You need the 30% (I think) when your commision is accepted.  to be safe I'd say have atleast 700 to put down if you're planing a lot of bells and whistles
 
I have 3 suits soon to be 4 from them, excelent builders, unsurpassed customer service

How stupid of me, I forgot to include the fursuit website that I am interested in...
http://www.mixedcandymascots.com/
 
Also, does anybody know if this fursuit maker offers the heads with movable jaws? If I am going to get a fursuit, im gonna try to get the whole shabang....claws, paws, tinged color fur, lycra skin on the inside, movable jaw, and whatever else there is :) .

Helpful Hint:
 
You may want to shorten the subject line of this topic when making replies in the future.   I have shortened your subject line to give a good example.:)
 
Long subect lines like these cause problems for some email users and most of what was in your subject line belongs in the email itself.
 
In the future try sbuject lines like:
 
"The fursuit I want"
"How much do fursuits cost?"
Etc.

I know that many of you have been anxiously waiting these, so here they are!

Theme
Our theme for 2009 will be Surf Safari! So, catch a wave and hang-ten off
the shores of a Polynesian isle, or hit the beach and grab a mojito under
the palm trees, listening to the call of tropical birds.

Hotel
The reservations system will open for our block on April 2nd. You can find
the rates on our hotel page, but we will not be putting up either the link
to the online reservation system, or phone number and block code until we
actually open.

Dealer's Room
Applications for the Dealer's Room will be accepted starting April 2nd.
Please see the Dealer's Room page for the form as well as important
instructions.

We're still working on revising a number of items for the website, such as
the FAQ for the Hotel, as well as some of our policies. Keep watching our
Forums, LiveJournal, and of course, our website for further updates and
information.

Remember to look closely at what you're buying with those guys. Many are not made of "real fur" upon closer inspection. It's either that super short fur, some sort of velor or a thin fleece.

Hi-4 entertainment, the volunteer fursuiting group based around the New York Metro Area (but doing some gigs a considerable distance beyond it) is always open to responsible, dedicated fursuiters who would like to use their suits for good causes such as community events and fundraisers. 

We are entering our our fourth year of volunteer public performance. Last year we did between one and five gigs each for sixteen different charities (plus a few fun non-charity events). If you're into helping out check out out website and send an email.

http://www.hi-4.org

-Damian

P.s. I know this is not the first call posted here, but the last one came over a year ago and a lot of new fursuiters have joined since then.

Not that I know of, but maybe someone else on the list has something cooking in PA. We do go pretty far into West NJ sometimes so if you live in east PA it's worth joining Hi-4.

You can also contact me privately or consult the list for advice if you want to start a similar volunteer group in your area.

Well yes .... it is very short fur or fleece, but at least until I finish my 
real fursuit, it is something to wear....

and I was pretty lucky on the price I see now a smiliar suit to the one I 
bought

is costing double what I paid now .... I had mine for 79$ dollar shipping 
included....

Hi everyone, Camstone Fox here - Programming Director for Rocket City 
Fur Meet in Huntsville Alabama, May 23 through the 25th.

And we've made some changes in plans at Rocket City Fur Meet ( 
http://www.rcfm.net ), and our good friend OldFreek is now running the 
Furry Variety Show at RCFM this year, and we've moved the show to a 
prime spot on Saturday!

But, we need more acts to fill the time slot we have set aside! So if 
you can pull together even a short skit between now and Saturday, May 
24th - and will be attending RCFM - we'd really appreciate hearing from 
you as soon as possible, and love to see it! It doesn't even need to be 
more than 90 seconds long!

Thank you for your time, and sorry to bother anyone - but we didn't want 
to miss any potential beginning performers!

Please contact oldfreek at oldfreek1 at yahoo.com or myself at 
camstone.fox at gmail.com if you are at all interested.

Camstone Fox
Programming Chair for RCFM 2008 and fellow fursuiter.

Sounds great!  I say go ahead and get started on it.

But... you may wish to remember that this is a G-rated list.  There
are other places where you can get advice on building other things.

Hello all, I asually just lurk on the list but thought I'd toss this out there.   I've been seeing more and more fursuit heads made in the balaclava style.  I've been making my heads from foam and plastic mesh and I was wondering what everyone thinks of the balaclava style?  Pros, cons, opinions?  Are they easy to clean?  Durable?  I look forward to reading everyone's thoughts on the subject, as I might make my next head may be in this style.
 
Thanks

The first head I made was carved down from a large foam block, my second was
made using plastic mesh and my third was made using a balaclava.  I'm now
working on my fourth head and  again I'm using a balaclava because I was
happy enough with the results I got the last time.  With out a doubt, the
balaclava based head was much more comfortable for me to wear than the mesh
based one.  I don't know how they compare in terms of durability, I tend not
to kick my heads around very much.  That said, first of my balaclava based
heads is pretty robust IMHO.

Of the three methods I've tried so far I'm very pleased with the results
I've been able to get while building up heads using a balaclava.  I will
probably not use a mesh foundation again.

So far I started with the balaclava style..its has good pros of looking proportional to the human body and being pretty decent...the biggest con I have noticed is you have to be extremely cautitous with most steps  to try and make sure your head isnt squished too tightly cause something while you progress further the stretchability shrinks and the mask can become very clingly to the face. I wasnt very careful with my first head and now i cant wear my first head for too long otherwise i get the worst head aches...

I do believe there is a tutorial on the fursuit community on LJ on how to do one..I don't think it has a ton of pics but it gives key pics and detailed advice and such..

Its done by Matrices and has a list of pros and cons compared to other styles...

http://www.matrices.net/balaclava.asp

and for more tutorials here is the fursuiting LJ:

http://community.livejournal.com/fursuit/profile

there may be more tutorials i haven't seen yet on there..

best advice i can give is make sure the foam/dummy head is atleast a comfortable inches bigger than your actual head to make sure its not squeezing your head like a grape.. :\

Is it possible to be voted off the island?

Loop, I want you to do the following:

Step 1: find friend/associate/family member. Let's call them [person].

Step 2: Say to [person], "Hey, [person], I'm on a mailing list 
consisting of:
* Professional costume designers who make their living doing this and 
are rather busy,
* Hobbyist costume designers whodo this for fun and maybe for a bit of 
money,
* Professional performers that need to avoid any sense of impropriety, 
and/or
* Amateur performers who don't want to face accusations of having less 
than pure motives."

Step 3: Show [person] your previous posts, and ask them if they think 
they're 100% appropriate for the mailing list. If they say yes, find a 
different person, and go back to step 2. If they say no, and offer ways 
to make them appropriate, then continue to step 4.

Step 4: Before posting, run the possible post by [person] and ask them 
to fix it up.

Step 5: Finally, post and/or profit.

Please. Post with the buddy system. I have no authority, mind you, and 
you might think this reply mean. But I present it as some friendly 
advice, before it becomes less than friendly.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled silliness.

I will second this notion..  I've seen some wacked out posts..  If  
things don't become more cohernet and on topic, I will be forced to  
unsubscribe you.

Sorry about that last abortive post . . . <sigh> This tutorial is  excellent 
- thanks for the link. I was very curious about the technique, but  like the 
idea of having room in the head for a fan or two, so prolly won't try  it out.

I am looking forward to trying the balaclava too =)

I imagine you could use a bit of 1/2" foam sculpted into the back or  
top of head where you could easily cut a out a square for a small fan  
and battery -and as always the muzzle is a good spot ;)

Yeah, I make all of my heads with a baseball cap as the base, a  
framework of plastic mesh, and shaping with foam, so I can place fans  
and batteries as I like.

I ordered my fan equipment online from Radio Shack for pick up at my local  
store . . . I used the item numbers/shopping list in Adam Riggs' "Critter  Co
stuming" book, but had a problem with the fuses and fuse holders as one was  
metric and one wasn't - so didn't end up using fuses. OK 'm I bad.

I buy my fans at newegg.com -- 60mm case fans work great, especially  
the Vantec Stealth fans, as they turn a little slower so are silent  
and push a pleasant amount of air.  I put them in series with a switch  
and an 8 pack of AA batteries for 12 volts.

I have never used fans. With the exception of Billy Boy my goat fursuit I
never felt the need for one. I could go all day fursuiting *Well over 15
hours not taking the suit off.* and never feel the affects of heat
exhaustion. Thou I would drink plenty of water just in case. There is no
reason to put my self at risk for some dumb thing like trying to be macho.
Going back to Billy Boy. I don't think a fan will help with him. Its not the
head that I feel the affects. Its the body suit. Its all of that long pile
fur. I might need to look into a cooling vest for him.

Boogi I know there is plenty of info on the subject of cooling vests in the
FAQ. I'm not a newbie to the list. =P

Subject: FL: Question about shipping fursuits/road cases for fursuit travel

Hi everyone,

Believe it or not, for the first time since 2003 I'm going to actually fly 
to a con again.  I said "never again" nearly five years ago after the 
luggage muncher machine at O'Hare crushed my Action-packer fursuit box 
both going there and coming back home, as well as the TSA being unkind to 
my fursuit.  So while I plan to fly, I'm not trusting my fursuit to the 
airlines or the TSA, especially my new one.

So first question-- what shipping companies are good for shipping a large 
oversized fursuit box across the country?  And can you get them to pick up 
from the hotel?  I would need to insure it for the full cost of the 
costume, at least.  Any preferences or experience on this one?

Also does anyone have any good companies that sell road cases that can 
stand up to the abuse of travel and protect a fursuit?  Rubbermaid doesn't 
make Action Packer containers that fit the dimensions of my new suit 
(especially with the new wings) so I'd like to ask if anyone knows of good 
places that sell road cases or other shipping-level containers in 
different sizes.  Thanks for any info you may have!

Hehe, nice one Donkey,  I personally like the balaclava style head, because
typically, there is less of a need for a fan.  But yeah, the muzzle would be
a good place to put a small one if that's what you want to do.
Generally, any computer parts website will have what are called computer
fans, a 30mmx30mm size fan would be good for a head I think.
http://www.buyextras.com/30mmdc5vfans.html that is an example of some fans
that you could buy.  You'd have to somehow hook up power via batteries to
that.

For details, there may be something about it on the list.

I tend to use the 5 volt fans rather than the 12v.  That way they run on
just 4 AA batteries which are easier to hide.

Although I have not fused my fans - I have never had an issue re shorting
etc.  And when the fans do die (hostile humid and corrosive envron) its
usually the bearings that fail rather then the coil.

Take care all

Those fans are awesome if they work for you.  They just didn't move  
enough air for me, especially in Philly in 98 degrees and 98 percent  
humidity.

With one fan in my muzzle blowing in and one fan at the top rear of my  
head blowing out, I get tons of fresh air and feel cool in any  
weather.  A small fan controller does the trick.

I used a 12 volt computer fan but run it on one (very easy to hide) 9 volt  
battery. It runs slightly slower (and quieter) but still gives enough breeze.

I was about to say, you can undervolt a fan with no problems. You can 
even get a switch that lets you adjust the voltage and therefore fan 
speed. It's called a variable resistor, potentiometer, or simply pots, 
in some circles.

There's a computer parts store in silicon valley called halted that's 
really great for fans and pots and the like. It's onlt 15 or so minutes 
from the hotel what's FC's held at.

Also, while I'm spamming y'all, what's better, in your opinions: Air 
going in the mouth and out the top, or air going in the top and out the 
mouth? The first seems to be natural convection, but I keep imagining 
headfur standing up like one of those tube advertisement 
attention-getter-thingies.

Hi Blackberry

Thats the same configuration I use.  A laptop 2.5cm x 2.5cm fan in the
muzzle blowing air in and a VGA cooler fan  4cm x 4cm in an ear taking hot
ait out.

Keeps me cool and also well ventilated for hours. I live in Brisbane
Australia where it is often the same environment as yours. :>

Take care

Marcwolf

In my opinion its better to take the cooler air in through the muzzle and
then out the top.

There are several reasons for this.

1.  Hot air rises and so you are using the convection to assist.

2. The head actually produces a lot of heat and you will also be sweating
(in in warm climate) so it is best not to rebreath that in.

3. CO2 build up can happen in suits.  This will give a claustrophobic
feeling and also make you feel groggy. Having the cooler O2 air being pump
into your face will let you disperse the CO2 and also get clean air.

4. As with No 2. The head produces heat and heat is often the enemy of the
suiter. Best to use the cooler incoming air on the face to aid cooling
(evaporation of sweat) and also flow it arund the heat to gather as much
heat as possible before pumping it out.

Hope this helps
Take care

Marcwolf

so watching online cartoons from adultswim i came accross a commercial for
www.yourotheryou.com

it's a prank website that is sort of a "samual L jackson prank call" thing
like they did for snakes on a plane, but you put in some phone numbers and
email and crap and then choose a personality to "harass" your friends and
pretend to be these people, then at the end of like 4-5 days it kinda goes
"ooop, gota ya!..........buy a scion >.>"

well one of these personalities you can choose is a furry "mascot" so far,
it's not horrible, not great, but they did do a little research lmao, he
gives links to a myspace that's around the personality wich links anthrocon
and afew other furryesque mascot suit makers/cons.  has a video of "here's
materials that are in making suits.." shoes a couple heads.... only thing
that is horrindus though is his "racoon" suit.......kinda creepy
looking..... other then that, it's all right.

anyone else find this?

I've also seen other commercials based on the campaign
too.

One of my friends pulled this on me. I thought I had picked up a crazy
fan boy. The emails said he would visit me, gave my address, and
became more and more frightening. It began to worry me, so I posted
the emails I had on my LJ. One of my friends quickly noticed that the
production level on the videos was too high to be made by an amateur.
After some research he found the Toyota site and the link to prank a
friend. The friend who pranked me saw the post as well and confessed.
After giving him a few choice words, we made up and he promised not to
do such a thing again.

I do not suggest playing this prank on any friends, as this one almost
cost me a good friendship.

The emails from the prank are chronicled here:

it's all in how you look at it too though, man.

the add campaign is assuming that no one would really take this seriously,
and at the very very begining of the "prank" it gives the "prankiee" a large
false psyc test where if you read the small print confesses that it's from
scion, handa's car line, and that you will be contacted by a "friend"
shortly there after.  so really you kinda accept it yourself.  really it's a
few emails, and some text messages, then a car commercial nothing to blow a
gasket over.

Apparently the advertising doesn't work well enough, considering that 
it's for Toyota (who owns Scion), not Honda. *cough*

The bigger thing to notice is a trend. First, subservientchicken.com, 
then Second Life, and now, this. Ladies and gentlemen, I bring the 
revelation that we're now... a target market demographic.

Expect the following new promotions to cater to the lucrative costumed 
consumers:

* Levis 510, with an opening for a tail, in both normal and stone 
washed.

* New chairs in Ikea, to make sitting in costume more comfortable.

* a line of large sunglasses that are compatible with muzzles.

* reaaaalllly long straws as an option for iced drinks at starbucks.

* Skunked, by Calvin Klein

Bobcoon, those things would be awesome!  Hehehe, especially the Levis, that
would give me an even better excuse to wear a tail where ever I go. Hehe.
 The chairs would be a huge help.  With my nine tails, sitting down is
really really hard.

Another thing I would love to see made would be car seats with holes for
tails, and vehicle roofs with the ability to raise up to allow us to wear
suit heads in a car.

You know what's better than a hole in the back of a chair -since with  
a hole you have to work at making sure your tail goes through it  
properly -A nice deep groove down the middle of the chair is much  
better since you can just simply sit and your tail just fits right in!

Ooooooooooo, yeah, it would have to be one deep grove though to fit my tails
in, hehehe.  Either that or they could make a cutout in the seat so that its
not a hole but a cut out from the door side that the tail slides into as you
sit down. Hehe.

haah that true I wouldn't mind a groove in my seat ^^ plus it adds for back
comfort as you can lean on the bulk of the tails and have a better posture.

Well, you'll never fit into a geo. You have to start thinking like a
"Tall Person". Something Tahoe/Suburban territory should have some
more headroom. So would a pickup truck. I once knew a guy who just
hated car roofs for some reason - convertibles all the way, there.

Ho about where the seat reclines has the groove so that you can put it off
to the side.   I think up the back might put mine to sleep... =\

And the pants, would these pants have a hole or a cutout that buttons over
the base of the tail?  I'm not sure which would last longer

heehee I was meaning the 'seat' part -but the back would work just as  
well =)  I used to wear my tail snowboarding and then we'd all eat at  
denny's afterwards - I always sat where these two booth seats almost  
met and it made the perfect comfy groove to just slide right into ;)

Bobcoon, those things would be awesome!  Hehehe, especially the Levis,  
that would give me an even better excuse to wear a tail where ever I  
go. Hehe.  The chairs would be a huge help.  With my nine tails,  
sitting down is really really hard.

Another thing I would love to see made would be car seats with holes  
for tails, and vehicle roofs with the ability to raise up to allow us  
to wear suit heads in a car.

Yeah. Why's it always the skunks and foxes that get catered to? And when 
us ringtails get out turn in the spotlight, it's creepy 
raccoon/owl/pinata things that tell us to buy milk trucks.

Me, I just turn the chair around and have the 'back' to the front. The 
head's noseheavy so leaning back wouldn't work too well, but leaning 
forward's perfect.

Also, what's with so many tails? One's not good enough for you? Hunh? 
Hunh? Hunh? Is that it?

Given some wide-in-the-middle tails, car seats are not really feasable. 
That and I fear someone trying to drive in costume with the low 
visability. Just begging for bad press, there. But you could always use 
a convertable, I guess.

Or a moped, and the tail could even dangle behind the seat. But it'd 
require the head to use a crash helmet as a base. And I'm giving people 
idears.

Fox costumes with tails should be able to fit into bigger, or mid-size cars, maybe SUV's....etc...
   
  Wolf costumes with tails should be able to fit into about the same ---- depending on the size of the animals you're using to compare-----------
   
  Hey! That's areat idea I just came up with!! A suit comparison chart, unless somebody else has already thought of it ------- any other ideas for charts? I suggest you try those Alan Foster painting books ------- they've got charts in them.....etc...both cartoons and *real* items......etc....or, and/or The Illustrated Encyclopedias Of Animals  (various authors). I had a whole lot of them ----- they're now in storage out-of-state for the moment. (If I had them I'd be able explain more about them and give you some measurements: examples: the lion, the horse, the dog, birds and rodents ------ mostly mammals (most advanced creatures I know)
   
  I also like raccoons ----- Do you know anyone that likes "Rocket Raccoon", besides me? I've got the premiere "Hulk" comic of his character and his (RR's) mini-series.....etc...I like the way Marvel Comics draws them both (not too raunchy, except for some scenes with humans and other animals ----- not per or fur verted ------ the humans are with humans and animals are with other animals, as well as "Killer-Clown" robots, and the villains.
   
  (You wrote about Foxcoon ----- do you have any photos and/or attatchments of himself and/or his character ------ or, just simply: what's his website code? Let me know if you can.)
   
  (Anything else I should know about? I'll try to give you more stats and sizes of suits ---- if/when I take measurements..........etc....let me know too, if you can)
   
  I like the format of this listing ----- the others too!! See you sometime!!

Pretty tame from what I have seen before from some of the media.

Lets just face it - furrydom is as about as diverse as SciFi. And there will
be all types of people in it.

Tolerance of differences are a big part, and the understanding that what
suits one costumer does not suit another. As I have often joked to non furry
people - When you are a 2 inch mouse who's best friend is a 60 foot tall
dragon - that fact that one of them is gay seems to pale into insignificance
:>

Take care

Marcwolf

One more suggestion:
 
An online blog or journal of your own would probably be a better place to post "off-topic" stuff like this.  Try www.myspace.com or www.livejournal.com and open a free account.

Fox costumes with tails should be able to fit into bigger, or mid-size cars, maybe SUV's............................

What exactly are you trying to ask, convey, or reply to here?
 
This really seems like TMI in regards to this list.  Sounds more like a one-tracked rant rather than a discussion with others. It dosen't seem to make much sense.

 Lets just  face it - furrydom is as about as diverse as SciFi. And there will be all types  of people in it. 
  
 Tolerance of  differences are a big part, and the understanding that what suits one costumer  does not suit another. As I have often joked to non furry people - When you are  a 2 inch mouse who's best friend is a 60 foot tall dragon - that fact that one  of them is gay seems to pale into insignificance :>
  
 Take  care

Most major stores sell large plastic tubs that are perfect for putting a
suit in.  Typically I have seen those tubs Those would be best if  you
drive, I don't know how they would do with flying though.

Sorry, no, I don't see any post from you regarding cases, Kit Kat. But 
now I've got the Kit Kat bar jingle stuck in my head.

EDIT: while writing this, your post popped up. Nebbermind. (Break me 
offa piece of that kit kat bar... Argh!)

I've got this whole theory about the dynamics. Essentially, it's because 
most fandoms have a large, mainstream corporate anchor. SF can revolve 
around Star Wars, Star Trek, Dr. Who, etc. Anime, while less 
centralized, has things like Sailor Moon, Dragonball, and the like.

But while it's tempting to say that this fandom has WB and Disney as 
anchors, they aren't, not really. You could have an entire con without 
one WB or Disney character. There's pretty much no official corporate 
presence, and the big names instead are from the fandom, and -let's be 
honest- unheard of in mainstream. It's a fandom made by fans, for fans.

Without a central anchor, the borders and definitions are, if you'll 
excuse the pun, very fuzzy. So if you ask 5 people to define the fandom, 
you'll get 10 answers. This is not necessairly bad, mind you, but it 
does make things confusing.

The dynamics are definitely different in this fandom versus other ones in 
that they're not dictated by a central script from a show,  series or
comic.  When Terraluna, Hugg E. Bear and I went to Comic-Con in 2002, 
we did walkarounds in fursuit, and comic-book fans would come up to us and 
ask, "What series are you from?".  I (as escort) would explain that they 
weren't from any comic or cartoon series, and were just their own 
characters, and that just blew their minds.
"No, REALLY, what show are you from??", they would ask again.
That always messes them up.

It probably also makes our fandom a little harder to understand because of 
this.  We did a walkaround at WonderCon as the Furry Superheroes and two 
confused comic-book vendors were wondering why they had never seen issue 
#1 of a Furry Superheroes comic-book that doesn't exist.

Even for people that want to get into the fandom (as I did nine years ago)
it's not easy to learn about the characters or the personalities 
involved-- you have to dive into a furry con and go for a few years before 
you find out who everyone is.

Going to the dealer room in a con, there's not really a single DVD or 
book that you can buy to learn all about the fandom and who's who, 
other than the obviously bad and inaccurate media renditions.
Just a dizzying array of artists of every stripe.  I still don't know who 
half of them are, honestly.  There's no comprehensive pocket Hitchhiker's 
Guide to the Furry Fandom that I know of, although there are some good 
starts.

So yes, with those differences going on, defining the fandom even for 
those truly seeking it can be difficult.  I think if you ask 5 people what 
it is, you'll actually get 33 answers.

At cons like Comic-Con or the like you see the DC, Marvel, Blizzard and 
all the other huge corporate booths with the massive corporate footprint 
all over the con.  I hope the furry fandom never has that happen, honestly.
Can you imagine Disney with a huge booth at a con?
(Complete with briefcase-wielding lawyers)?

Personally, my entry into the furry fandom was quite the opposite, in I 
created my character and TV show a whole decade before the rest of the 
fandom officially coalesced.  Indeed I'm not sure I would have become a 
part of the community without it, even though I was inspired by other 
rabbit media stars of the time.  As I've pointed out in my interviews 
on "The Daily Show" and the movie "Behind The Mascot", RTR was 
partially meant to be the mascot that my hometown of New York City 
ought to have but doesn't.  So I've always had something inherent to be 
representative of...if not The Big Apple, at least my TV show.

About a year or two ago, in his LJ Yippee Coyote cited a photo spread 
of  costume characters from some magazine website with the caption quiz 
"Mascot or Furry"?  Amidst all the mug shots of sports team mascots on 
the page, the only two cited as Furries and not Mascots were myself and 
Thaddeus Fox.  Nevertheless, I maintain the the two of us are indeed 
mascots also--because I represent a television show and Thaddeus 
represented an online comic strip.  And neither of our artistic 
endeavors targetted the Furry fandom per se but aimed for a general 
audience.  After all, my show was borne of Public Access cable.

Having the Rapid T. Rabbit Show as an affiliation has helped other 
suiters in my area gain access to events that offered open-invite 
public appearances such as during independent minor league baseball 
games.  I've been supportive of my friends here regionally to offer my 
show as an umbrella under which to sign up for these small-to-medium 
sized events.  Our collective efforts eventually led to the creation of 
Hi-4 as our local volunteer character entertainment group.

> The Rubbermaid Action Packer is the classic.

The Container Store website has some trunks that can be used on the 
airlines that are within the limits. I have the Storage Locker with 
wheels, #10004629, 32" x 17" x 12-1/4"h, $30. Unfortunately, the wheels 
got ripped off by the airlines on its first round trip. You might be able 
to find this at Walmart for less. TCStore has steel trunks, too!

http://www.containerstore.com/

One larger trunk I had since 1983 they nearly demolished by causing the 
top and bottom to get pushed in and the corner and side brass protectors 
to get ripped off or pushed in. The next one from Target had the plastic 
protectors broken or ripped off and a corner separated.

The airport luggage and TSA gorillas have got to quit abusing luggage like 
that. I saw something in Kmart in the sporting goods section called, if I 
remember right, a "TSA Lock." You set the combination and use it to lock 
your luggage, and a number on the lock body corresponds to a key that the 
TSA has to open it normally. Thus, they don't have to cut it off. I think 
a few of you use regular colored plastic ties to keep it closed and the 
TSA uses their own to reclose.

And, Donkey, no, I wasn't planning on quoting the FAQ, since you already 
have a walk-in freezer somewhere nearby to cool you down. (hehe) But 
seriously, the FAQ's now the Wiki. I'll go through the company list as 
there's a few that are gone or moved when I got time from my classes and 
put the changes into the Wiki.

There's an even better trick. Pack heat.

http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/09/expensive_camer.html

The short jist is that baggage carrying weapons have to be checked in 
front of you and locked with a non-TSA lock, going around the usual 
screening (since it was done in front of you) since they don't want any 
chance of a loose firearm.

The trick? A starter pistol, the one that fires blanks and doesn't need 
registration in the US, counts. So if you inform the checkin that you 
have a weapon to declare, and have them check the luggage containing (in 
this case, it was camera equipment) the starter pistol, it'll get 
through with extra care and less rummaging.

No, I haven't done this. No, I don't suggest making the cons have more 
starter pistols than the NRA. But yes, it is tempting.

I can verify this because I have gone through this process myself before 
but I wasn't carrying a starter pistol.  The ticket agents *love* it 
when someone needs to check a firearm.   Where I live it's rather common 
and there is no registration on firearms here.  Also one time they lost 
a bag containing one.  They gave it a VERY HIGH priority and got it back 
within hours.

The basic consensus of the comments is that you should send via other 
methods than check it in. Personally, I still don't trust the TSA or the 
airport gorillas with anything expensive or hard to replace in my bags. 
Observe the quotes mentioned about O'Hare and some other airports. They 
still have to be held accountable.

Every once in a while, my hearing aids will set them off. I've always kept 
two baggies around, one kept in checked luggage with small penknife and 
some other personal stuff. The other will have coins, keys, hearing aid 
batteries, and other metallic items for the xray machines. But do not ask 
me to put my film through the machine. I nearly went off on a TSA for 
doing just that, as I had 800 film in there in a CLEAR baggie and I told 
them to hand check it.

A few times way long ago, I was able to pack clothes around an Atari 8bit 
computer and floppy drive in the luggage and they'd come out intact. 
Today, I don't think so. I wouldn't even put hearing aids or someone's 
cochlear implant behind the ear unit in luggage. I can see it now, an 
$8000 CI BTE unit missing and the owner going off on the TSA people, who 
are then claim "we're not responsible" and threaten arrest. Let's see the 
TSA and airlines worm themselves out of THAT one when the fallout from the 
CI and deaf community hits the fan...

Just wondering, but has anyone actually worn their fursuit feet just for 
the heck of it all the way to the end of the flight?

As someone who has traveled extensively with fursuits, I can tell you 
that there is no one "perfect" solution. But I thought I'd share my 
experience of flying about 65,000 flight miles so far with anyone 
interested...

My longest lasting case was a "cube" container (approx 20x20x17) clear 
box from the container store ( 
http://www.containerstore.com/browse/Product.jhtml?CATID=71235&PRODID=62981 
) that I "melted" holes in each corner for tie-wraps to hold the corners 
in. I needed the cube because it was a little taller and would allow me 
to place my fox head with the larger ears in it, and not be concerned 
with them being folded or crushed. Inside the case, on the top - I 
always had a spare set of tie wraps in case TSA opened it, and they 
could reseal it. The colors of the tie wraps in the case were a 
different color than the ones on it - So I knew if someone had looked 
through it before I left the airport. On the inside of the box, I had a 
full page size name and address label affixed so it would be easy to 
identify. I never had any issues with the luggage tags sticking to it, 
even in multiple-jump trips across county. It held a full suit, and head 
with room to spare, including a can of enbac inside. Never had an issue 
with enbac and traveling this way. It's waterproof (although not water 
tight) and it's inexpensive at $20. My biggest complaint I had with it, 
was lugging it around with me, since it had no wheels and that meant I'd 
have to potentially carry 50lbs in my hands to the rental car or to 
where ever I was going. With another piece of luggage, and a briefcase 
that I usually carried - this was a pain in the tail when waiting in a 
long line for getting my boarding pass at places like SFO.

And the case did finally meet it's demise though. While traveling 
recently, it came out of the oversized baggage area with the corner 
smashed and cracked. Fortunately, everything inside was fine. This had 
to be a pretty serious hit, because the case is modestly flexible and it 
looks like someone must have dropped it from the top of the luggage door 
on the airplane onto the runway (and likely when the case was still cold 
from traveling in the plane's hold. But, for $20 that I spent - it 
lasted about three years and through multiple trips.

Everyone I have talked to say that action packers (You can find them at 
target, http://www.target.com/ ) work pretty well, and at $28 they are 
not a bad deal. They and my "cube" met the requirement that all bags 
must be less than 63 linear inches in size (Add length, width, and 
height together, has to be less than 63 inches total... so for the 
action paker, 17+18+23=61, 61 < 63, so good to go.) Just be careful of 
the weight, since anything over 50lbs will get hit with a $25 surcharge 
(the same as an extra bag in many cases, with many airlines.)

But the baggage handlers at some airports still are just as apt to drop, 
bounce, throw, etc. your baggage around as they please. I've had my 
luggage lost as well, which is no fun. Especially when you've got an 
important meeting the next day, and the only place that is open is Walmart.

I'll probably get one of the action packers to replace the cube that 
died in service. Also, I'll be getting a pair of collapsible luggage 
wheels for hauling it to the rental car/hotel.

Recently, I've taken to wearing a partial when I travel - and I've 
gotten a hard sided bag. (Like this: 
http://s7v1.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/000008067?$product$ ) I can 
place the head and a tail, with paws in the piece of luggage, and still 
have room for about 5 days worth of clothes for fun and pleasure. All of 
my trips in the last year have been done this way. If you're smart, you 
can find pieces of luggage like this in yard or community sales for 
about the same price as the action packer or the cube I used.

Also, anyone thinking about going with a starting gun in their case - 
trust me, it's a lot more work than it's worth. Many flight destinations 
don't allow a gun in their town, unless you have a handgun permit. So 
"if" once you land, and if you are seen with it... you can be arrested, 
gun confiscated and put in jail. (Example, Washington DC has a no 
handgun law that's in front of the supreme court.) Plus there is a lot 
more than just getting a starting gun and throwing it into your luggage, 
you will need carry permits and other articles in order to travel with 
it - unless you want to take the risk of being arrested and detained at 
the TSA's discretion and pleasure. (Yes, I just finished talking to 
someone on Friday who was detained in an airport for hours for a similar 
incident... and they were a government employee, who was federally 
permitted to carry a gun on a plane - but had it in their luggage, 
unloaded, with an approved trigger lock - and it took hours for him to 
resolve the issue with multiple phone calls.)

So, here are some hints to those of you thinking about traveling with 
your fursuit:

1) Make sure that the case you get is less than 63" linear length combined.
2) Make sure it's semi-rigid, and has some give to it, so in case it's 
dropped from 4 feet, it doesn't shatter.
3) Mark it on the outside as well as on the inside, with your name 
address and phone number.
4) Consider partials, if you travel a lot - and just doing it for fun.
5) Keep anything that you otherwise put in the case (enbac, scissors, 
electronics, etc) in an easy to find case or clear zip lock bag that can 
be pulled, opened, examined and replaced - easily.
6) If you can use tie-wraps or zip ties, do so rather than locks, and 
include extras in the case where inspectors can easily find them.
7) Use the body to wrap around the head, so that it acts like packing 
material.
8) Pre-weight the case to make sure it's under the 50 lbs limit. Many 
hotels also have weight scales that you can borrow or use.
9) Make sure that when the bag is checked by the airline, that you get 
your "luggage chit."
10) If it's really a concern, consider alternate shipping methods such 
as FedEx, USPS, or UPS and have it shipped to your destination hotel. 
Call the hotel and let them know beforehand that there will be a package 
arriving, so they know it's coming, and can hold it for you. Get the 
best address information from the hotel management on what address to 
ship it to. And don't be surprised that the cost is $25-50 each way with 
tracking.
11) Invest in a set of luggage wheels, and not the cheapie ones either. 
If you have to lug much stuff, it's definitely worth it at the end of a 
long day of travelling.

Your tub idea is an awesome one, Camstone.  I wouldn't have thought to do it
that way. But I don't know if I would ever trust the baggage handlers at any
of the airports here in the USA with my suit.  I have had bags lost before
and they looked pretty scuffed up when I got them back.  Not just that, but
with my current nine-tailed suit, I would need to have about 3 or 4 bags
just to contain the tails as well as the head and body.

I'll just stick to driving when I want to take my suit somewhere, I think,
makes my life simpler.

Hey all!

Just dropping my 2 cents in, I concurr with Camstones findings: In my 
case I just used a standard run-of-the-mill Rubbermaid container that 
made it under the 63" limit. Inside said container I would stuff all the 
"fragile/Non crushables" of the suit: The head, cans of Walbac with a 
hard plastic cup taped over the business end, my repair supplies and 
whatever else I felt needed to go in there that I didn't want crushed. 
As for the Bodysuit, I went ahead and carried all the "Squishables" in a 
big duffel bag: bodysuit, paws, feet, all the more Sturdy stuff that I 
know could take a beating. I usually duct-tape this box shut, and I have 
never had a problem with TSA opening it up, as they usually seal it back 
up pretty decently.

Especially these days where the airlines are trying to reduce the number 
of bags one can take, flying with multiple people Really helps: Kat and 
I just pack everything into those two items (one box, one bag), and then 
when we get to the airport we put it all through at the Curb Side 
Checkin (I feel good tipping those guys!) Then when we ge out I grab one 
of those $3 rent-a-cart dealys if we have to haul the stuff around, as 
my bag/box combo has never had wheels in the entire time I've been using 
them.

Carryon-wise I take a small backpack with my underwear in it, in case 
something Does happen to the luggage then I still have a change of 
clothes. If I have a laptop, I take that laptop bag in with me too: Both 
the backpack and laptop bag have fit in my flight space Very well. It 
only becomes a problem when I'm hauling back three 30-packs of White 
Castles from MFF ;)

I was just wondering since I have just started on my nose what is better to add over my clay to make my nose shape... leather/pleather or tool dip? or if there is other suggestions to do my nose since it is going on a balaclava head?

Since it's already furred, IDK how well tool dip would work.  Id probably go
with pleather.  Stretch it under the fur that is there already.

I'm currently in the same dillema, and I think I've settled on tool dip.
There are no seams or weird wrinkly bits with it, (unless you mess up XD).
It dries fairly quickly, and ends up looking pretty natural.

theres glue, anyone have any tips on how to fur a balaclava head or even
just sewing it maybe?

What are you putting the head on while attaching foam / furring it?

I either use a real live human [to keep it stretched to the right
size], or a bust (foam/plaster/whatever head) that has human-like
measurements. Something around 23-24" around the forehead is right
when I want it to fit me. There's maybe 2" max flexibility... so you
need to be somewhat close. The 18-20" styrofoam heads are not really
workable.

It is good to sew some of the pieces of fur together from the patter and not use too much glue, but a major key or two is that the base your building on is about an inch or so bigger and that the fur is cut a bit larger than the pattern.

I don't know about 'coloring' the base fur, but if the spots are large  
enough you can shave out spots with a razor and then insert fur the color of the  
spots you want. It's time-consuming but looks really, really good!

I would stay away from coloring the fur in any way, because that will only
generally bleed out or run, if given time.  Mezzobean has a very good idea,
but yeah, it is time consuming, but can be well worth it.

I'll give it a try, I just didn't want to have to cute holes in the fur and
sew in spots, that would take forever, so if I shave down the fur then I can
loop it in kinda like croche or something..or glue it with something? hmm..I
wonder if I can get that iron on patch thing and just glue on some fur ontop
of it..would that work? though I'd shave off the fur first then iron on the
patch then glue on some fur onto it.

Although shaving out a spot and inserting your other color fur is, well,  the 
cat's meow in spot making, you can also just sew a spot right over the  
existing fur if the shaving is toooooooo much.
 
 

         
 
Here's my son at Anime Boston 2007  
in one I  did that way.
 (Hmm, I wonder how a bikini wax would work. LOL )

Two things I forgot to mention, although they're kinda obvious . . . one is  
not to cut through the base fabric of the fur while you're shaving the pile  
off - you want that for the stablility, and second make sure you orient the 
pile  of the spot fur in the same direction as the base fur <duh> before you go  
to all the trouble of sewing it in!

I agree, heat plus fur equals a no no... remember synthetic fur is flamable! Plus the fact that the iron will just melt the fur... unless you want a plastic suit rather than a fursuit, then you can be my guest there.

Hi. I'm very interested in the wolves or the fox, but would need to see
what they look like of course. I've been hoping to buy an extra fursuit
that I could afford for some time now.

Will any of these fit someone who is 5'10" tall?


I tried to email this to you privately using three different email
addresses, and all were rejected. It appears that spamhaus.org on your
server is rejecting everything I try. I'm sending plain text with no

I'm on my fifth suit, and I still used the old tried and true method:
- cut out body and sleeve panels according to McCall's pattern (is it  
8256?)
- sew together except for one side
- fit suit by pinning up slack evenly along both sides
- remove and invert suit
- mark pins and remove pins
- repin on marks and sew new seams (except on one side)

Blackberry's method sounds good, though I also have the same problem I'm
making a Cheepard suit two of my many backgrounds put together into animal
form ^^ a German Shepard and Cheetah heheh...so yeah I needa GET fur first
but the whole suit thing is a little more complicated with me since I'm
going to have digigrade legs.

I use the same method for my suits, it's really good if you don't have a 
complicated fur pattern.  Be aware that you will end up wasting extra 
fur as you fit the suit to your body.  I also found it helps for you to 
wear the suit while someone else pins up the slack.  Once the suit is 
pinned up, move around and make sure the suit isn't too snug in the 
wrong spots.  ;)

On a slightly related note, I have been thinking of making or getting a fursuit made to go along with a pirate costume I have put together. The pieces all come from dresslikeapirate.com and fit me a little too well at times as I look like a genuine pirate when I don it. I have several pirate characters that I role play and would to bring at least one of them to life. The question is, how? My face and my hands are the only parts of me that show and there is a coat that is worn that would pretty much obscure any tail I would buy or make. The species of the characters are canine, mostly wolves. Any suggestions of turning this pirate costume I love wearing into a fursuit?

You can make paws that have attached sleeves so they fit under whatever 
coat or shirt you wear.  I would recommend making and wearing a tail 
anyway, you'll likely see the "bump" of a tail under the coat.  It's one 
more detail that furs might not immediately pick up on but makes the 
outfit more "real".

Since you're wearing normal clothes, you need to make the head as small 
as possible to keep the scale right.  If you make it too big you'll end 
up looking like a toon or worse: a person wearing a mask.  I'd recommend 
making a basic mask, then use fur to wrap around your head; sorta like a 
furred hood that's attached to the mask you make.  Additionally, if 
you're good with makeup and facial appliances you can paint on a mask.

Subject: FL: Shamanic rattle for trade
Message-ID: <33990.39893.qm@web63109.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

I want ot trade a shamanic rattle that I made for a few balaclavas if anyone is interested.
  Pictures here> http://zoharskarth.deviantart.com/art/Shamanic-Rattle-82205714
   
  Description: 
  This is a shamanic rattle. It represents the Upper, Lower, and Median realms. I made it myself out of hand stretched leather, bone, paint, etc. 

It helps the user into a trance to travel to the Upper and Lower realms and seek out truth and spiritual knowlgde. It allows the person a direct contact to a divine source. The two realms that the shamanic practioner travels to are represented by the two wolves and two moons. The white wolf is the Upper World, and the black wolf is the Lower World. Don't confuse this with Christianity, it's not gonna send you to hell or heaven.

This enables the journeyer to voyage into the realms and contact their spirit teacher/guides and spirit/power animals. Both can aide the shamanic practioner through all of life. Whether it's contact with your spirit animals in the Lower World, or a chat with your spirit teacher in the upper world there is no limit to the power this possess and can unlock in the user. I have labored over it endowing it with some of my own energies to befin the magickal process. The shaking of the rattel alters brain waves and carries you off on your journey. 

Comes with instructions on how to use. At first you might want to have a friend shake it and send you on your journey, but it can be done solo as well. Good for groups!

Ever want to talk to animals? Or chat with the dead? (I once had an odd conversation with Sigmund Frued). Ever want to unleash your potential, or gain knowlegde? Ever want to experience what its like to BE an animal? Ever want to call upon your own spiritual power?

This is an answer to those. Comment for the trade, best offer takes it. Only one. I'll trade it for as many balaclavas [link] as possible, I've got masks to make... The bidding goes on until April 18th, highest takes it... 
   
  I hope someone is interested, I'd like to share my shamanic beliefs in an artsy way...

One thing make sure you trust the person doing the pining. They might get
ideas like... "Oops I slipped" And you saying "*OUCH!!!*... I'm going to
kill you once I can get untangled for all of this fur!" You would be
surprised how often that happens.

Believe me, even saints get ideas when they have pins in there paws. Now as
for me. I *can* be trusted.
*thinking to my self.* "To run away as fast as my hooves can go after I stab
a fur."

Subject: FL: Important FC 2009 Hotel News - DoubleTree Sold Out
Message-ID: <20080409191715.GA86125@critter.net>


The demand for rooms at our convention hotel for FC2009 has been
unprecedented this year. Not only unprecedented for FC but for the
Doubletree as well. They have never had an event of our size sell out as
quick. Our 8 suites sold out in under 10 minutes and the Exec level floors
in a shade over 10 hours. The bulk of the other rooms in the hotel went in
under 72 hours, and we actually determined that we'd sold out for sure
Monday afternoon. There is no chance of an expansion of our block at the
DoubleTree because, quite simply, there are no more rooms to be had.

For folks that did not get what they want, our deepest regrets. Our hotel
staff is doing their best to help as many people as possible.

To answer the frequently asked questions that we've been getting:

Q: When will I be notified if I have a Suite/Exec room/Fursuit floor
room/Party floor room?
A: Our hotel liaison staff are working on room allocations now. We'll notify
people who requested Suites first, then Exec level rooms, and then work down
towards Fursuit and Party floor rooms. Please be patient
- we will be contacting you.

Q: Is there a waiting list for Suites and/or Exec level rooms?
A: We already have large numbers of people on the waiting lists for these
rooms, and are not taking any more names for these - sorry.

Q: Will you have a waiting list for regular rooms at the hotel?
A: We're sorry, but we are unable to offer a waiting list for regular rooms.
If we eventually have enough cancellation to allow us to re-open the block
at the Doubletree we will do so and announce it beforehand.

Q: Will you have an overflow hotel?
A: We are presently negotiating with another hotel for rooms at a
'convention' rate. We are hoping to get this available as quickly as
possible, and will announce when this is available and what rates we can
offer.

Q: I was able to book some rooms at the con rate and another at full rate,
will you be able to convert them to the con rate.
A: The hotel will let us do that for some rooms, but they will eventually
cut us off form any more requests. We will contact you in email regarding
those issues as we get them solved.

No, they are official costumes that I own and this is an unliscensed 
appearance and therefore unpaid....but a pretty fun one.
The suiters who wore them last year can't make it to NJ this time.

Here is video of the appearance from last year...

Actually, I have a few issues of Rocket Racoon, including the final episode. Collected many of the Spectacular Spider Ham comics. Some of those characters would make great fursuits. Like J. Jonah Jackal as The Black Jackal.

We will once again be in the Holiday Inn Select Memphis Airport, located at 2240 Democrat Road, Memphis TN 38132-1807. The special Mephit Fur Meet rate is $99 per night for 1-4 people in the room. Rooms are available with one king size bed or 2 double beds and your choice of either smoking or nonsmoking. The layout of the hotel is perfect for MFM with the main level being on the 3rd floor of the hotel allowing everyone to be either on the main level or not more than 2 floors up or down. So it makes getting to panels, socializing in the Garden Court (a huge atrium area of the hotel) or fursuiting a breeze. You can book your room online at:

http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/sl/1/en/cwshome/DPRD-79FJRE/MEMDR/website/

or

Call 800-653-6524 or email mfmdirector at hotmail.com to make your reservation!

Don't wait till it's too late! Suites are already SOLD OUT!!

 

The hotel promises that they have a lot of the issues encountered worked out for this year. (remember we had a total staff change just a few weeks before the con!)

 

--=={ MFM Spirituality Track}==-- 

 

We are looking for panelists!  If you can share your expertise or you have resources you would like us to include in this year's topics, please contact us. I guarantee we'll have you working overtime.

Pshaw and I have been working hard implementing your suggestions from last year.  This year's focus will be Pan-Asian mythology.  We'll be looking at animal symbology and therianthropic connections in the literature of India, China, and Japan.  Almost everyone knows about the fox maidens and the raccoon pranksters but we'll be looking at some of the less recognized figures: phoenix, bat, chicken, and others.

Our mythological totem animal will be the eastern dragon.

This year we've also decided to add a new panel.  We will be discussing the mythology of a common animal and we've chosen the horse for the debut of this panel.

At your request, the meditation panel will be split into two separate panels, each an hour long. The first will be for those who don't know how to meditate or need a refresher.  We will explain the process, answer questions, and you can share your own experiences.  The second panel will be the guided meditation panel in which you'll be taken on a journey to possibly meet your totem animal.

We intend to continue the Christian furs round table but we need someone to coordinate the panel, come up with a topic, and lead it. We would also like to expand our offerings in this area.   A panel addressing the symbolic aspects of animal mythology in the Bible and the Christian faith has been suggested.  If you can volunteer your time, please contact us.

Pshaw will be hosting a panel which will show you how to make totem shrines out of common objects such as Altoids tins.

We are also trying to put together a panel about shapeshifting from the shamanic perspective.  If you can volunteer your experience, knowledge or resources, we need you.

We're look forward to seeing you at MFM 2008!

 

--=={ Gaming Information }==-- 

 

MFM Gaming is coming at you with something new and fresh for 2008. Now, we're going to offer you the chance to run games and potentially earn Volunteer credit!   The new system will allow us to schedule your games, find you players, and run successful and fun games.  If you're  interested in running a game or gaming event at MFM, please send a  note to jarrodhenry at gmail.com and talk about what game you want to  run.  ALSO!  If you're interested in PLAYING a game at MFM, please  send that note to JarrodHenry at gmail.com, and we'll try to get it set  up.

We specifically would like people interested in playing or running JadeClaw/IronClaw, D&D 4th edition, WOW TCG, and MTG to give us a shout out on the email.

MFM Gaming this year will strive to bring more players to the table  and a more cohesive gaming structure than ever.  Back will be DDR, the  poker tournament, and all the things that MFM Gaming has brought you  in the last year.  Besides the new scheduling setup, we're also going  to offer Smash Brothers Brawl!

 So, come forward, gamers, make yourselves known either through
 jarrodhenry at gmail.com or on GamerFurs.NET and get ready for MFM 2008!

--=={ Tiger Haven Auction }==-- 



For years Mephit Fur Meet has proudly hosted a charity auction with all proceeds going to Tiger Haven Sanctuary. Hikaru has done a wonderful job organizing this auction for years but has finally decided it is time to pass the torch, this year the auction will be run by Hikaru's once assistant, PrincessB. 

 

I hope to make my first year a huge success but I have to have you for that! It is not too early to start looking for items you would like to donate. Without your donations this action would not be possible and that makes the big kitties sad! We are still looking for donations for this year's Tiger Haven Charity Auction. This can be art, commissions, clean plush, anything Furry related

 

Remember, this is not some faceless organization that you have no clue how much is really going to help the cats. The Tiger Haven ladies are there ever year able to answer any questions you have, and you can check out their website at www.TigerHaven.org

If you have any questions or will be unable to attend MFM but want to donate something for the action feel free to contact PrincessB and she will gladly help in any way she can.

Thank you for continuing to make The Tiger Haven Charity Auction a big success every year!

 

For even more info see http://www.mephitfurmeet.org/charity 

 

--=={ Programming }==-- 

 

Want to share your knowledge? If you would like to take on the task of heading up a panel, email the name and a brief description of your panel to our programming director, Maui.  Contact Information can be found at http://www.mephitfurmeet.org/programming

 

--=={ LAN Gaming Information }==-- 

 

Once again this year, MFM will be featuring LAN gaming. Bring your machine and participate in a free-for-all-furry-fragfest! The LAN will have (at least) limited Megabit support this year. We'll also have some new games.  Expect to see a lot of the newest games!  Requests are welcome. We are also planning a couple exhibition matches you won't want to miss.  More details on these in the near future.

 

--=={ Video Room }==-- 

 

The MFM Video Room, serving your Viewing Pleasure! 

We had a lot of fun in 2007, showing all the Best in Furry vids and movies... and we're doing it again in 2008!  We will once again be having the "Viewers Choice" timeslots that allow you to Vote for the vids you want to see.  Some of these choices will be the Furry Classics, but some of them will be chosen from the Newest available movies!  We will also bring back the other Favored events from previous years, which include "Film @ Eleven", "Weird Stuff found on the Web", "Fans & Freaks" - which was partially filmed at MFM, and (of course!) "Meet the Feebles".  So check those Schedules, and stop in the Video Room once again to see what Great Furry Vids we are showing for your
viewing enjoyment!

 

--=={ Video Room }==-- 

 

Here is a short synopsis of what I had planned for this year's Meet:

1. The Thursday Night Open Call Show is once again planned, with lots of new music, puppets, and performers. .

2. "Who's Puppet is it Anyway" is also arranged. Just like the TV show, puppeteers will act out a series of funny themes and actions. Last year, the puppeteers had a blast, as did the audience.

3. Panels: 

One on "Behind the scenes", where a beginning puppeteer can see how the stage, sound, and video is set up. Also, give tips on performing behind the stage.


Another panel will be about "Beginning Puppeteering: You have a Puppet...Now what?" This panel will include basic 'how to' tips and techniques: how to animate the puppet, how to lip synch, how to come up with a short script, etc.



--=={ T-Shirt Contest }==-- 

 

1) What's up for grabs?

There are three chances for your artwork to be selected for MFM's T-Shirts.

**Attendees Choice - The winner of the Attendees Choice will have their artwork featured on the front of the MFM T-Shirts.   This is chosen by you, the attendees (natch). 
**Director's Choice - The winner of the Director's Choice will be featured on the back of the MFM T-Shirt 
**Staff Choice - This will be chosen by the staff and be featured on their staff shirts
Each winner will receive a free attending membership.

 

***Complete details and rules on the website http://www.mephitfurmeet.org ***

 

--=={ MFM Masquerade }==-- 

 

"I'm also going to need to have you come in ... on Sunday."

Yes, that's right, it's time to start thinking about the Masquerade at Mephit Fur Meet.  Now's the time to start coming up with ideas.  Remember that there is a Theme award, and this years theme is "Office Space."  The other thing people might not have known from last year, is that there is sign up for the Masq on Friday night.  I do have cookies there for those that sign up early.  It helps me find out if we need to find filler.  If you don't have an act, I am planning on having a script or two available, if I can convince the 
right people.  There will be more details along the way.

 

--=={ Dance/Karaoke Information }==-- 

 

Can you DJ?  Can you spell DJ?  Do you know someone named DJ?

The MFM dances are being 'regrooved' this year.  You wanted more 'party' type music and less 'rave' so we're looking for talented DJ's to play at this year's convention.  Experience with rock, roll, pop, house and disco is strongly preferred.   Amateur and
professionals are equally encouraged to submit an audition mix to sumatrae98 at yahoo.com.  Selections will be made in the Spring.  If you've already submitted, you don't have to do it again. 

 

--=={ Share Your Interests With Others }==-- 

 

MFM recognizes the diversity in interests among its attendees.   In an effort to provide folks with special interests with a place to meet and greet, MFM will allow groups to make use of its unused space, free of cost, to its attendees.   For more information, please contact Tyger Cowboy.  This will be provided on a 'first come, first served' basis.

2.  Costume Con Party
3.  Pre Registration
4.  Get Involved!
5.  FC09 Video Room wants you!
6.  Dealer?s Room update
7.  Next staff meeting


1.  Hotel News:

a) Doubletree Hotel completely Sold Out.

APOLOGIES: Yes, we did something that has never occurred at the  Doubletree for
any event, ever. We sold out the entire hotel in less than one  week. In fact,
the hotel expanded our block on some of our bridge nights to  pretty much
capacity without requiring us to sign another contract. We  already were at
capacity on our primary nights.

The Suite and Exec Level Waiting lists are full.  Last year, we made  it to the
July fourth weekend before completely selling out. Our apologies  for its
suddenness this year. We truly did not expect the situation to unfold as
rapidly as it did. Be assured that the matter has been escalated to the Board
of AAE, Inc. to take into account as they pursue contracts for  FC2010 and
beyond.

CANCELLATIONS: While we do expect some cancellations, they tend to occur late
in the year. If we have enough cancellations to matter, we'll  reopen the block
there. Our cancellation rates in the past are usually less  than 10% but we
will be watching closely in case we can reopen that block. We urge any one with
a Room who discovers they will not be able to join  us next January to please
make that decision and to cancel their reservation  as soon as they can.

SHARING WITH FRIENDS: We realize that many of you regularly share a room with
specific friends at the convention.  If this is the case, please contact them
and see if you have more rooms booked between you than  you will be using, and
contact the hotel to cancel any extras.  This will help us enormously as we try
to get as many people into the DoubleTree as  possible. 

Additionally, we urge anyone who has spare space or is looking for  space to
use our Ride/Room Forum at the following url:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/forums/>

RUMOR CONTROL: One bit of rumor control, it was rumored that individuals were
booking entire large blocks of rooms. We have reviewed the booking report and
compared any multiple bookings to past year's patterns.  Nothing unusual is
apparent in that review.

SPECIAL REQUESTS: We expect to have emails out for all Special  Requests by
April 21. Please be patient with us until then. You can imagine how many emails
our Hotel Staff has to write after confirming that the  requests are in order.

We do have a few Fursuit Floor transfers still  available if you already have a
regular room at the Doubletree Hotel. You can  continue to request those via
the normal procedure in our Hotel FAQ.

b) Overflow Hotel

After some quick work, we have obtained an overflow hotel just as we did last
year at the Holiday Inn San Jose. That room block will open on  May 1, 2008.
All rooms there are Double Queen and will be available at the  rate of $95 per
night. Parking is free for guests at the Holiday Inn. We also  have a small
block of Suites there for $199 per night and will be offering  those to folks
on the Suite Waiting List we already have compiled. If we have any left after
we do that, we will open that waiting list up to additional submissions.

SHUTTLE SERVICE: As we did last year, we will have a Shuttle Service  that runs
between the two Hotel's to help assist those in the overflow  hotel and those
in the Doubletree visiting friends at the Holiday Inn.

For information on the overflow Hotel and how to book there when the  block
opens on May 1, 2008, please review the following web page:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/hotel>

One piece of good news is that we have already discussed expanding  the block
at the Holiday Inn and should be able to do so if we sell out the  initial
overflow block. We can't promise, but we wanted folks to know we were planning
ahead as best we can. We have to be judicious in our block size there since if
we do not fill that block to 80% capacity come convention time. After last
minute cancellations, the con would have to buy any  unsold rooms.


2.  Costume Con Party

Further Confusion is having a room party at Costume Con on Saturday,  April
26th starting at 7pm. Sorry, that we do not know the room  number at this
point, but look for flyers at Costume Con for more info.


3.  Pre Registration

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/registration>

It's still $40 to pre-register for Further Confusion. Don't delay, do  it now !


4.  Get Involved!

While it is only April, it's never too early to get involved with  Further
Confusion. We have a number of open positions across the entire scope of staff.
Being a staff member can be both challenging and rewarding. If there is a
specific field you are interested in helping out with, please email
hr at furtherconfusion.org and mention what you would like to help  out
with, and it will be directed to the appropriate department.


5.  FC09 Video Room wants you!

Have you ever wanted to work for FC, but didn't know how your  
knowledge of Furry films, videos, and collection could help? Well,  
FC09 is working to rework our video room. This position would include  
putting together a playlist, managing staff to run it from the hours  
of 6-7pm until about 8 - 9 am, and to make sure our video content is  
great for our convention goers. For more information or to share your  
ideas for the FC09 Video Room, please contact  
events at furtherconfusion.org. If you would be interested in taking on  
this position, please email HR at furtherconfusion.org and tell them you  
want to run or work in the FC09 Video Room.


6.  Dealer?s Room update

We have presently sold out of all tables other than the Half Table size 
spaces - and even those are going fast.If you would like one of those half-table spaces, download the form from 
the Dealers Room website <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/dealers>, 
print it out, and then fill it in requesting a half table. Include a check 
for US$65.00 (US$70.00 if you want a space with electricity), and then 
mail it to the address on the form. Act quick - these final spaces will 
sell out soon!
Any of you being REALLY observant might notice that this is EXACTLY (except 
for the year in the URL) as the one we had in our May 2007 newsletter for 
the 2008 convention. Yes, we only have HALF tables left again.


7.  Next staff meeting

Our next staff meeting will be on May 10th, starting at 1pm in the San Jose
DoubleTree hotel. Parking is free - we will be providing stickers at the
meeting which will allow the parking staff to know you were with Further
Confusion, and let you out without needing to pay.

Is that a real problem? As I understood it the Holiday Inn San Jose
room block has all ways been filled every year and other hotels in the
area had to be used.

For some time, I had been thinking of going to RainFurrest, but that has changed.

As much as I'd like to fly to Seattle for that fur con, there is an event that same weekend on Saturday that I nave been attending the last two years and will not pass up going to again this year:  

The 20th National Skunks as Pets Show, in Daytona Beach, FL.
http://skunksaspets.com/show.htm

I will be again bringing Basil with me to show him (maybe win a few more ribbons too) and get together with other fellow pet skunk owners.  Maybe I'll go to MFF instead.  Anybody going there needing a roommate?

Today is the big Release Day for what has to be the most controversial game
of all time.

I know alot of you that will own (or eventually own) the game "Grand Theft
Auto IV" will probably be stuck on the Single Player portion of it for
sometime.  But, rather than playing with the lot of deusch bags and immature
12 year olds that shouldn't even be playing the game, I decided to get with
friends ONLY to play this during the multiplayer sessions.  People I at
least know are mature enough, and that won't act all l33t on the microphone.


I own the game on Xbox 360.
My gamer tag:  "Laphin"

Feel free to add me if I'm not on your list already, or just mail me back
your GamerTag personally.
I can't wait to see you guys in Liberty City!!!


( I can't believe GameSpot gave it a 10/10! )

Ok, it seems I have enough to get fursuit.org back up online.

The mail list is in tact.

The mail list archives from 2006-current are in tact.

1996-2006 Mail archives are crippled, not sure if anyone actually dug into
these, so I don't know if there is any need to try to salvage them

The fursuit.org members list display and editing is gone..  but again, I
don't know if anyone actually used this to make it worth while repairing
(the database is intact, just none of the website processing to
display/edit it is)

WIKI is in Tact.  However it is in Read Only Mode for the time being,
pending some password linking code that was lost.

There is no system for volunteers to be assigned as extras because the call 
for them tends to be rare. If someone's skit needs extras, they are 
encouraged to advertise for them in appropriate forums.

Not many. Thus, the sales results of Conker's Bad Fur Day.

Are we talking a video game remake of HeeHaw?


Okay, to keep the post even slightly on-topic, here's something from the 
"Things that make you go hmmm" department.

Ages ago (May 98, oddly enough), I was reading one of the more sarcastic 
computer magazines I subscribed to, and did a double-take at the table 
of contents:

MAC TO BASICS Jeff Hemmel's beginner's column looks at "Five things you 
probably haven't done yet." Jeff originally listed six things, but he 
was afraid that many of our readers wouldn't have a giant chipmunk suit 
in their garage. He obviously doesn't know his audience.

I've been searching for ages, and finally found it again. I didn't 
hallucinate it! 
http://web.archive.org/web/20010226185204/www.mactoday.com/cont_may_june.shtml

Sadly, the advice is now mostly obsolete (save for backing up data) and 
no chipmunk-related information was given.

If anyone knows a "Koi Fox" aka Lynne Hassell, or if KoiFox is here in 
this community....

Please tell her that they have a customer who commissioned them for a 
wolf suit where they paid a 1200-1300$ deposit back before January who 
is looking for them.

The mother of the guy who commissioned KoiFox called me this morning 
thinking I'd know this person and is desperately trying to find KoiFox 
to demand refund or to get the suit finished or something.  She said she 
found my number on a business card her son picked up at AnthroCon last 
year which is where he commissioned KoiFox.

I don't really appreciate getting calls from other fursuiters' customers 
who are desperately trying to find contact information like a phone 
number or mailing address...  I'm tired of cleaning up other people's 
messes.

That's good... she has a site

Too bad there is no phone number or mailing address on that site to give 
to the mother who called me.

"Billy" in the guestbook is the name of the guy who was commissioning 
her.  He posted that 10 days ago and hasn't gotten a response, I imagine 
they also emailed her.  The mother and the guy aren't getting responses 
on their own which is why they called me..
She said she's going to try to call "AnthroCon" hoping someone there has 
her information like a phone number since she was in the artist's 
alley(not sure?) last year.

I really don't want any part in this,  that's why I'm hoping if anyone 
here knows koifox or is a friend of hers can try to relay the message 
that they have a customer desperately trying to contact them...  and 
calling up the customer would be a good thing at this point.  I have the 
phone number of the customer on my phone.

Thanks for the info,  I passed along the information and all seems to be 
valid.  The mother got an answering machine when she called, but the 
names in the recording were accurate.

If it was the mother of the boy, then your business card is her only contact.  Don't feel offended that you are involved.  Who else is she gonna call.  If she's anything like my mom, she can't use one of those new fangled internets.

I'm wondering how old is the guy is that he has $1300 for a fursuit. But he
has to get his mother involved in getting the fursuit or a refund. He must
be something like 18-19 and wanted a fursuit instead of a car.

Good lord, they paid someone over a thousand dollars without getting 
a real name, phone number and mailing address? You wouldn't buy a 
used car that way, would you? I'm tempted to say they deserve getting 
ripped off, but a sucker is born every minute. Where do they live, 
I've got some leftover tar from a paving job and I can do their 
driveway reeeeal cheap...

You do not have to get insulting and rude! Kids get over existed over
getting things that they want and don't think of such things.

Well,  if this KoiFox kept her site up to date and actually provided a 
mailing address and a phone number on the site,  then the kid and his 
mother wouldn't be in such a predicament.
It can happen, to lose track of contact information, or to accidentally 
throw it out...  to not make more readily available on her site is bad form.

The guy has tried e-mailing Koifox and has left messages on her guest 
book with no response from her... what more can be done?

There really isn't any need to be so condescending.
Yeah he shouldn't have let this drag on,  after speaking to him on the 
phone, he has a shy and kind of meek personality,  the type where he'll 
let people walk all over him, not necessarily a sucker.
He commissioned her after AnthroCon last year, 1300$, and in January she 
demanded more money when it was completed beyond their agreement.  
Apparently she's done this to other customers,  it's all here:  
http://community.livejournal.com/fursuit/2355723.html

The matter should be closed and dropped now though since we've tracked 
down a phone number, mailing address and even found that she owes the 
state of VA money for her business registration from 2007 and all this 
has been relayed to the kid and his mom.

Appropriate forums could include here, the Anthrocon webpage's Fursuit 
forum, the Anthrocon Livejournal, or other relevant locations where the 
interested party feels they can garner attention from prospective costumers.

Did you not realize yet that this tread is here for the sole reason to
specifically annoy you? See everyone here on fursuit dot org all got
together in a secret meeting. We decided that your life is not annoying
enough. So we went and started this tread just to make your life that much
more annoying.

I just hope that the hundreds of millions of pounds that we spent just to
annoy you was successful in its goal.

If we where not. We will have to all get togerter again. With out you
knowing where we are meeting. So we can come up with a new plan to just
specifically annoy you.

His Most Royal Highass, Donkey

Let thsi be a lesson, just cus somone can make a furusit and si good with a 
sewing machine doesn;t mean you should give them money or take take 
commisions.

There are very few makers out there I trust with my business despite their 
possibly "too good to be true" prices and quality of their work.


To many peopel dont realsie takign commisons si a responsability and runnign 
a design shop has to be treated liek a real job, these are peopel slives, 
soo many out there will take your money and screw you withotu thinkign twice 
about ti, oh i'm sorry I got busy, i dotn have time to do yoru suit, but I 
already spent your money.

Sorry, No, I  do not play that game, there is a reason I stoped using some 
makers and continue to use others.

I hate to say it, but I haven't been on the list all that long, and I 
remember something similar earlier this year. Different circumstances, 
sure, but still a case of non-minor sums of money changing hands and 
someone nigh dissappearing or otherwise uncontactable.

And I've got a feeling that we'll see this happen again several times 
before the year closes. This one seems to have some particularly foolish 
elements, but... Does there need to be public service announcements 
regarding this?

Good idea: Commissioning a studio that uses a cheshire cat logo
Bad idea: Commissioning a studio that can actually vanish like a 
cheshire cat.

Good idea: Exchanging contact information
Bad idea: Contact information only contains a name like "shadowclaw"

Good idea: Agreeing on terms, costs, materials, and schedules 
beforehand
Bad idea: "Make it look really really cool!"

Good idea: Shop around, make sure the studio is reliable, to your taste, 
and has a good reputation.
Bad idea: OMG, you have a sewing machine? Can I commission you?

What else am I missing?

I'd suggest possibly escrow, but given some drama explosions I've heard 
of, no escrow company deserves to be in the crossfire.

I'd say so. Your tips are a good start; I'd suggest the fursuit 
community come up with a "Fursuit Commissioning Worksheet" form that 
potential buyers can use to keep track of all the details on what 
they're buying. We wouldn't want to get a reputation that anyone 
commissioning a fursuit has a 50% chance of getting ripped off, and 
because of the expense the few who do have bad experiences will make 
a lot of noise about it.

Include builder's real name, physical address, not P.O. Box 
(residence or business; call it "workshop"); mailing address if 
different; telephone numbers and e-mail address; brief overall 
description of costume; expected delivery date; intermediate dates as 
needed; payment terms and amounts, dates of progressive payments. 
What else?

That's what they're paid for. Furry drama is nothing compared to some 
cases they deal with all the time.

But for many builders, I expect the initial partial payment is used 
to buy the materials, and the balance payment upon final delivery is 
their labor/profit.

It also sounds like it could possibly be generalized into commissioning 
with art as well, and made into a convention panel. Maybe a skit to go 
on youtube. At the very least, a page or two in the wiki.

Oof. Really, a commission is a contract, and it could go on and on. But 
that's a great start.

Other things that are less general, though, would be a design. Not just 
"taken from a drawing this other guy did, but without the wings" but 
something that looks more like blueprints (Front view, back view, 
side,)

The other thing I really wish was more standardized was color. We don't 
need pantone swatches, but it wouldn't hurt, neither.

Edge cases of it not looking "just right" or the color's being off seem 
to be something that could be headed off here.

> That's what they're paid for. Furry drama is nothing compared to some

True. Million dollar contracts going sour with lots of lawyers involved 
versus livejournal flame wars.

Actually, that sounds like it could be a hilarious episode of People's 
Court (as long as it's nobody we know.) "Your honor, he didn't make the 
paws large enough and the rainbow hair's all wrong!"

I thought it was half up front, the other half after the mark's done and 
confirmed. Wait, wrong kind of contract. Although more than just 
material purchase would be good, for no other reason than it might 
reduce distractions of needing other income.

Perhaps 40% up front, 60% on delivery? It really depends on 
circumstances.

I would be willing to help you get that up close and personal feeling.

All you will have to do is is take this. *I hand the wolf a peace of
light weight cardboard that has a black picture of a wolfs upper body
on it.* Just take that out into that field. *I point out into a large
field.* and hold it up about wast high.

*I take out a fifty caliber sniper rifle out of its case and get it ready.*

OK I am ready to give you your close and personal experience.

I'm a liberal tree-hugger, but I know enough Zonies that it's just
intriguing at this point.

Sorry, but don't expect this ass ever to show up. NYC and NJ are driving &
parking hell holes for truckers.

I hope you find some one willing to help.

Heh, well diesel and otherwise is going up *everywhere*...  But I digress--
I can at least offer my attendance to said panel, if I end up going to FAU.
It's still a tenuous thing for me right now.

??? Where did you learn math? You should have said $.02335 per gallon.

I bop the fox on the head with a Nerf bat. Not only for trying to be a smart
ass. But failing to do it correctly.

I am just glad that your a fox and not an ass. I would have be ashamed for
my species.

Don't worry! I know that its real hard for you to think. How can anyone
think with yiff permanently on the brain.

Not to gripe at anyone here, but can we at least -try- to keep things on 
topic?...this list is really going down the tubes lately with all the 
non-related banter going on.  GTA now Fuel prices....People...this is a 
FURSUIT list...take it somewhere else., there's plenty of other places 
for general chit chat.

(and sorry to add to the spam and this is not directed at anyone in 
particular, just the subject matter...nothing personal)

Now to add something that is on topic... I still have a new black body 
suit I want to sell.  It's cheap, it would be good for a shorter 
person.  I made it, and then decided to go with a different type of fur 
for the rest of the suit, so don't need it now.  Email me if interested.

Ditto. Make fursuits, not spam.

On that note, my wife promised me a sewing station in our house to make 
the bodysuit for "Camstone II." Of course, I am still waiting for the 
nursery in same said house to get cleaned out for our 4 month old 
daughter. =/

Any suggestions on supplies specific to fursuiting that I should get, 
from the Pros?
Already have a good strong sewing machine, and the basic supplies... so 
anything not so obvious?

Heylos all!
  Thanks to Tim Kangaroo, who posted his video of this years Fursuit 
Parade at Califur 2.4!  By a count of the suits in the video, there were 
64 suiters in the parade: Total fursuit count at a Con with (i would 
estimate) about 500 people attending would be close to 80, as there were 
quite a few suiters (including myself) who watched the parade from the 
sidelines, which means that a little more than 1/6th the attending 
populace of the con were Suiters this year :) (Makes me feel all warm n 
fuzzy, considering how many new fursuiters keep showing up year after year).

Anyhoo, Enjoy the Video, and Thanks Again, Tim!!

if you want to, go ahead and wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

Well, maybe not NEXT Friday, but Friday, Aug 29, is also the day to 
sign up for the Masquerade.  I will be out in the Garden Court 
(hopefully with cookies) for those signing up.  Right now would be a 
good time to work on your skits as well.  The more prepared you are 
when you get there, the quicker the rehearsal will go, the more on 
time we become.  There is also a list for those that want to sign up 
so you can kick ideas around.  I would also like to know some ideas 
if you already have them.  I still might have a script or two for 
those that don't have anything already, but we shouldn't rely just on 
those.  Don't forget, the skits can be about anything, but there is a 
"Theme Award,"  and incase you haven't heard (living under a rock or 
something), the theme is Office Space.  This is always well attended, 
and well received.

Subject: FL: repair job on local mascot
Message-ID: <6089C1C4-6372-49C9-9652-781D379CC0CF@flyingfox.biz>

Hello!

I may have scored doing some work on a local mascot at a family  
entertainment place -they really want to install a fan or two in the  
head.  I am the kind of guy to practically do it for fun minus the  
parts costs but they already said they'd pay mileage and I have a  
feeling I could even possibly be their local go-to repair guy for  
future needs.  Anyone have any tips, suggestions or stories about  
this kind of thing?  I'd love to hear if you have some to share.
Thanks!!

wow good for you, I've been trying very hard to get a job around mascotting
and fursuiting, but to no avail...-.- Kudos to you my friend! as far as tips
go I don't have any really other than don't say "I can try " cause then that
kinda just throws them off the whole thing really, but still good luck and I
hope all goes well ^^

Hi there

Saw your post to the Fursuit List just now and was curious whereabouts you are located?  What is it that you are trying to get involved in?  Do you have your own suit?  Will you be at anthrocon?

who me? umm well I live in Ontario, up in Markham and I have a few partials
I gotta pick up from a move still wich is proving to be difficult but if I
had the right amount of monies like 75 or so I'd have been working on my
Fursona suit -.- I fear I'll be missing Camp Feral this year again...thats
really the only Con I've ever been too. I was hoping to go to Anthrocon or
FA or whatever else is happening but like always that requires money and
therefore a job, but no one wants to hire me cause I live in a damned group
home ><

This is really topic and personal.  It is the kind of discussion for private email, not out in the group as a whole.

Hi there
 
Saw your post to the Fursuit List just now and was curious whereabouts you are located?  What is it that you are trying to get involved in?  Do you have your own suit?  Will you be at anthrocon?

wow good for you, I've been trying very hard to get a job around mascotting and fursuiting, but to no avail...-.- Kudos to you my friend! as far as tips go I don't have any really other than don't say "I can try " cause then that kinda just throws them off the whole thing really, but still good luck and I hope all goes well ^^

Hello!

I may have scored doing some work on a local mascot at a family entertainment place -they really want to install a fan or two in the head.  I am the kind of guy to practically do it for fun minus the parts costs but they already said they'd pay mileage and I have a feeling I could even possibly be their local go-to repair guy for future needs.  Anyone have any tips, suggestions or stories about this kind of thing?  I'd love to hear if you have some to share.

Hi all, I was just wondering if anyone knows what happened to Darkstone Realms?  Their website has been down for a while now and was wondering if they are still in business, and if they can still be contacted?


Thanks

That was talked about on list some time ago. What people here think is that
they went under. Which is to bad. I liked there half masks. I got two of
them some years ago and might have gotten some more in the future.

I heard that they did not go under but that they closed their site so they can catch up on older orders.

That's a bad business decision . In the long run you will only hurt your
self doing that. People will not want to trust you if they don't think your
a stable business. NO, there gone.

Good claws are found at greyowlcrafts.com, they sell them in bulk, and they
look really nice.  Discounted long fur... Hmm, well there's a shop near me
that has it, if you live anywhere near Mt. Vernon, WA...*snickers*  But that
one still escapes me, good luck^^

Peace,

While I'm sure there's other places to get a harness, why not get one from 
a husky fursuiter:  http://shortwave81.livejournal.com/profile   Shortwave 
Husky custom-makes them.

Coolies thanks for the link, I need one too, as I plan on pulling a sled
around FWA09 a bit in my new husky suit that'll be done by then.  I've been
looking for a while for a harness and I've yet to find something that I
really like, this may do the trick.

Hi

I usally use Long Fur Floor about 100mm

Try that:

http://www.maskottchen-germany.de/german/referenzmascot/Wollemaus.htm

or other way but looks more Doll like.
Look for thick woolen strings also used for Petroleum Lamps -  thickness about
5-7mm and cut em in length and glue each one in a textile which you at
last will glue on the head.

Greetings

Great advice but where do I find each. I like the woollen strings idea as it
needs to look very doll like.

Have you considered 1/3 inch imitation satin ribbon? It has a good luster and flow to it and should look on model up till the closest inspection.

Have you considered 1/3 inch imitation satin ribbon? It has a good luster
and flow to it and should look on model up till the closest inspection.

Hi

Looks they still do, unfortuneatly even my direct contact mail addy
because i did business with em ins sort of mascot sales does not work.
So to get in touch is a problem unless you live nearby.

The point that they do old works to pressent looks true because i got
recently a costume i ordered a couple of months (8) ago.

In Europe look for

www.stoffelle.de

I get my fur from there and they offer various colors and top quality
form european artifical fur makers.
But its not that cheap as in the USA. But the quality is brillant.

I am still working on my suit, but I am also interested in buying a one. Please tell me its a canine of some sort. I am interested in Wolves, Foxes, and Dogs....suits that is .

Just tell them that you know Donkey and watch the fur fly. Well.. Not

Hehe....Ostrich...good one! Thanks for the comment. I'm not much of a fan of the toony suits. I do admire the creativity that goes into some of them, but my suit is a reflection of my spiritual self. I'll be choked if anyone copies it.

salem, nc -there are quite a few belly dancers who entertain at the  
drum circles too -they would absolutely go gaga over you!  hahah they

Dear Mr. Donkey;

We received your packet of photos here at Bud Tugly Costumes, Inc, and 
we must say we are quite impressed. Unfortunately, we are unable to 
start mass production on it quite yet. The craftsmanship is quite 
high-quality, and we would not be able to recreate it. Furthermore, for 
our standards, it must go through a review, and frankly, it looks 
unlikely to meet our requirements. First, there is not much call for 
ostrich costumes, except for the partial design in which it looks like 
you're riding the bird. Because of this, it would be difficult to sell 
it to our primary rental shop clients. If you could produce a design 
more in line with their format, the approval would be more likely. 
Perhaps you can consider something that resembles a cross between Donald 
Duck and Goofy?

Sincerely,
Bud Tugly
CEO and President
Bud Tugly Costumes, Inc.





Seriously, though, very awesome, Johara. I lean towards toony designs 
myself, but your costume roxxors.

anyone know where I can get some hoof to paws missiles?

I honestly don't know at this point. I work in construction (odd mix huh?) and it's hard to get time off in the summer. At the moment, I have my eyes set on rainfurrest or FC. Additionally, I'm looking into indo jazz dance classes in hopes of putting on a performance at either one. Your gallery crawl sounds like a hoot...this city is so lame, we don't have anything nearly that adventurous.

Most of the furries that are on list have jobs. How else do you think we can
afford are fursuits.

By the way I am not a yak I am an ass. But the idea of a yak fursuit is a
nice idea. There are not that many yak fursuits if any.

I work 60 - 70 hours per week...I have more job than most people and, at times, more than I would like. Being a yakky furry is about the only break I get....and when I'm not yakking, I get suited up and get yiffed by the neighbors dog (no other furries in the area).

Try being a trucker! I wish that I could drive 70 hours a week. Heck I wish
that I could drive more than 70 hours a week. The more I drive the more I
make. Also I am in the truck 7/24 so I might as well be driving. I have
nothing else to do.

I used to drive a tow truck, and I know another raccoon who drove a big 
rig.

Now, what would be really surprising would be, like, an exec of a 
fortune 500 company or a high-profile politician. Although they would be 
able to buy a really high quality costume then...

I think I've got all the bases covered. I work in advertising/marketing and
do a surprising amount of coding. My biggest clients are national building
product manufacturers, whose livelihood requires a lot of trucking and
construction.

I can tell you we've got furs in every branch of the military both US

deployment.  Need I say more?

I work as a Part-Time Shift Supervisor in a Security Firm contracted by a well known Hospital throughout the states. The rest of my time goes to full time college studies, and the rest goes to working out and going out and having some fun in the wild....litterally! The mountains that is! Then the beaches.

Try being a trucker! I wish that I could drive 70 hours a week. Heck I wish that I could drive more than 70 hours a week. The more I drive the more I make. Also I am in the truck 7/24 so I might as well be driving. I have nothing else to do.

I know that there are quite a few furs in the military. I think a Navy
Captain is the highest rated one that I have heard of. Well that was as of
2004.

I know that there are quite a few furs in the military. I think a Navy Captain is the highest rated one that I have heard of. Well that was as of 2004.

I just wanted to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone for their kind remarks on my suit and the bits of chat that followed.
The hardest part at this point is, we don't have any furry events in this part of the world and are forced to travel south of the border to attend one. Feels like wearing a diamond bracelet under a long sleeve shirt. Well, I really look forward to meeting you at a con, and with any luck, it'll be later this year or early next.

Well I would think so since there bears. They would have to be bears since
they bear arms.

I bet some people think that I should have been a sheep and not an ass.
Since I have such baaaaaad jokes.

Yeah but it's hard to tell who tho, I know i've got at least 2 other furs in my company.
Had one other who's out of the army now but was constantly harrased by the other guys after they found out.  Grunts can be so cruel...

You should try the bible belt way here in the States. You can literary be
beaten to death for being non conforming.

Not that I am ageist conservatism. I am a conservative. What I am ageist is
people not letting others be different than them selfs. Thats one thing that
I love about furry. Conservative, liberal, gay, straight, Christen, Atheist
no mater what you are your welcome into the herd. The only thing that will
get you baned from furry is being a non hoofed herbivore. =b

There is a Yak associated with The Detroit Free Press. Probably the best thing about that paper except for the comics section.

Most of the furries that are on list have jobs. How else do you think we can afford are fursuits.

By the way I am not a yak I am an ass. But the idea of a yak fursuit is a nice idea. There are not that many yak fursuits if any.

What does all this banter have to do with Fursuits???

I'm ready to hit that unsubscribe button any day now, but being on this 
list for over 10 years, I really hate to do it.

Why don't the couple of you that continue to spam this email list, go 
find a nice IRC channel or IM client to chit chat about your lives with?

Thanks
-apologies to those that DO stay on topic here.

I also drive a semi. But is a bit different than what you typicaly 
think about a truck driver.   I drive LTL (less then Trailer Load) 
P+D (Pick up and Delivery) and pull a trailer with a lift gate. its 
not uncommon for me to be dodging low hanging wires and tree branches 
making a delivery to a home based business, and most of my day is 
backing up into a dock.

Hi

Thats nothing special
We do that regular here. I even use my moped and drive sometimes in
public.
Why not as long you harm no one.
The only thing who could be happen is that you maybe get a tight jaket
on afterwards.

Those of us across the pond (aka the atlantic ocean) from europe should
realize or at least remember that europe (especially countries like austria)
are generally more accepting and forgiving that many americans.  This i feel
is due to the fact that america was originally colonized by europe's biggest
tightwads at the time.  Lets not forget that the pilgrims were so uptight
that england wanted them to leave.

How uptight do you have to be for england to say, "get out".

I don't know. Maybe i'm wrong.  BUt i've always heard that there are many
places in europe that its "ok" for 2 men to hold hands in public without
being gay.  *gasp*

Either way, its nice to know that there are some places in the world willing
to accept furries.

Heya everyfur--

As the few of you on this list who know me know, I was born with a birth
defect that ended my left arm a few inches below the elbow joint.  Now, as
awesome as a Megaman-type gun-arm thing would be, I am looking for some
honest help here.

How exactly would one design a fursuit that would fit my arm and still look
good?  I thought about using a prosthetic arm, as I used to use one, but
stopped long ago because of the weight and clumsiness of it.  In short, it
was expensive (like, over $1500) and not useful at all.  In fact, it was
more of a hindrance than a help.  I mean, I rock climb with one hand, for
god's sake.

So, I have decided that in future fursuits, I will just make it so it
conforms to my left arm the way it is.  But, my question remains-- how would
I make it look decent, what with padding and all?

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated^^

I suppose the easiest answer would be something like a mannequin arm or 
some hollow plastic hand-shaped model. When halloween comes around, I'm 
sure there would be some false lower arms for sale that could be used 
for shape.

Honestly? I say a gun-arm thing would rock. Especially since it sounds 
like you have a foot or more of space for any electronics and 
animatronics. Or maybe a translucent hand that glows various colors, 
like some arcane magic-caster. Or, ironically enough, a hook, for a 
pirate. Or some cybernetic arm that's unenclosed, showing wires and 
gears where flesh would be. It really depends on the species and 
character, but it sounds like you're the type that could turn it into a 
strength and real oppurtunity.

Either that or have the false arm held on with velcro, so you can rip it 
off and beat people over the head with it.

Hope this helps,

What about making most of a normal sleeve, but tapering it to a point  
and putting a foam rubber cone in it to hold the form and give it body?

rock climbing -awesome!!  i just do a little bouldering now and then - 
fun

I wonder if just simply keeping your suit arm tailored to your  
natural shape would be good -that way you would be able to move and  
interact like you normally do and honestly i think it would be pretty  
cool and unique =)

for a prosthetic though -maybe a tube of light-weight, stiff plastic  
or mesh just to hold shape and a foam paw in a 'mostly' open fashion  
for waving hellos and hugs (i'm imagining if it is too open though it  
may look too unnatural)  with the foam paw you may get some bounce  
out of it to where you could bob it back and forth in waving and  
other gestures ;)

birth defect that ended my left arm a few inches below the elbow  
joint.  Now, as awesome as a Megaman-type gun-arm thing would be, I  
am looking for some honest help here.

How exactly would one design a fursuit that would fit my arm and  
still look good?  I thought about using a prosthetic arm, as I used  
to use one, but stopped long ago because of the weight and clumsiness  
of it.  In short, it was expensive (like, over $1500) and not useful  
at all.  In fact, it was more of a hindrance than a help.  I mean, I  
rock climb with one hand, for god's sake.

So, I have decided that in future fursuits, I will just make it so it  
conforms to my left arm the way it is.  But, my question remains--  
how would I make it look decent, what with padding and all?

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated^^

to fire the gun you could use a pressure switch taped to your arm.the switch would be the same micro switch used in paintball markers.you could use rc motors or air valves to move the arm for you.your real arm could fit into a foam cone and velcro.the air hoses and electronics could be placed in a bag on your back as part of the suit.you could use high power led to light the gun/arm up and your eyes too.

I'd build it like a normal fursuit arm and stuff it with fiberfill like a 
plush.

You could probably put a PVC pipe "bone" in it if you wanted to keep it 
stiff.

I vote for something cybernetic or robot looking as well. The anthroid
side of the fandom has been largely ignored.

 Synth,

I think I'd go with the idea of constructing an essentially standard fursuit
but with a sewn-on paw and a stitched-in baffle where your natural arm ends.
 Use a pool noodle and some polyfill to give the appendage structure.
Perhaps you could use some system of snaps or velcro that would allow you to
attach the paw end to strategic locations around the body suit to create
adjustable poses.

Other than that, I'd go with the totally awesome Mecha-gun arm with lots of
blinkies!

My first suit had a Bionic arm on it, and it proved to be a good talking point with other fursuiters. Bionics aren't much used, which means they're unique and therefore easily noticed. Since my suit was a hedgehog, and I was the first hedgehog suiter, I had +2 unique points!

I was pretty popular.

FANTASTIC Dragon!!
I am sure the group in LJ Fursuit would love to see this wonderful one!  I
would love to see a close up of the face with the eyes!

How did you make the wings? PVC like mine, I am wondering?

LOVE the colors! VERY bright! Great tail too!

Thanks for the tips everybody^^  I may actually pursue an android-type gun
thing on a later suit, but for the next two I am currently working on, I
will use the tapered-idea suggested by Blackberry.  As construction
progresses, I shall post pics (on FA most likely) and link to them on the

I know how you feel there. I was doing about the same (sometimes up to 91

the 37.5/50 split. Currently looking for a second one to fund my suit :)

Just another thought...  I've seen a small handful of zombie wolves and 
fursuits out there.  You'd be able to do something that none of them 
could: have the lower half of your arm hanging on by a few stringy veins 
and tendons.  People will wonder how you pulled off such a neat effect.  :)

I just returned from seeing Wall-E, and the thought crossed my mind... how
do the animators at Pixar avoid the "uncanny valley" effect so prevalent
with the 3D or "follow-me" eyes in fursuit head?  (link here for an
explanation of the uncanny valley, if you're not familiar with the concept:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)  Especially with a robot
character such as Wall-E, it could be easy to run into the uncanny valley.
Wall-E's eyes are partly sunken into his well, not his head, but into his
camera-thingy, and covering that is an outer lens, which conveys some of the
sparkle seen in a human or animal eye.  Extending this to suit heads, could
a similar arrangement be used with 3D eyes (with the pupil and iris sunken
back as usual, but a "lens", of plastic or what have you), or has something
along those lines already been done or attempted?

I would love to help, but I had to send my head back for repairs, I'm not sure how long it'll take. I do live in Rochester and just got my fursuit in June for AC. Plus, my schedule at work isn't steady, I get different days off every week.

I'm looking for responsible, reliable, and competent fursuiters in 
Rochester, NY or in reasonable travel distance to Rochester, NY with public 
performance experience and their own visually-appealing fursuits who might 
be interested in some family-friendly public volunteer work.  Contact me at 
rigeltiger at gmail.com for details.

I've felt this uncanny valley thing before too lol -I think that our  
"toonyness" factor in the fursuit database search is an indication of  
it also.  It's sorta like the more realistic the fursuit, the less  
likely you are to evoke an "awww you made him cry" or such response  
from people when interacting but then again the more realistic suits  
seem not generally used for those public entertainment purposes but  
are a helluva lot more impressive at fur cons ;)
I had lots of friends say they get the creeps from the follow-me eyes  
when I was building Scape (I really dig them though;) so I made them  
slight and they turned out ok. -Jeeze along those lines, people get  
creeped out by goat and horse eyes in general so that was a bit of a  
challenge too.
Anyways -North puppy has really cool eyes that have that shiny  
reflective look.  It seems you could get that effect if you used  
lenses from some form of eye protection -would want to make sure  
whatever plastic you use is made specifically for vision though since  
it is hard enough to see through buckram fursuit eyes as it is lol

I think the fact that character's in pixar films like wall-e and toy story
don't think they are human to a high degree helps mitigate any effects that
the uncanny valley may produce.  ie: because wall-e recognizes that he
himself is a robot not a human, humans' who watch the film will be ok with
it.

That's all i can come up with and it certainly doesn't explain the lack of a
valley effect in movies like The Incredibles.

I would have to say that the 'uncanny valley' response is not illicited by Wall-E due to the fact that he is clearly robotic in nature.? His shape and form are far from human, so even though we may project our emotions onto him and empathize with his efforts, he is still very clearly robotic in nature.? Therefore, we aren't threatened by his human-like characteristics.? It's kind of like the Brave Little Toaster.
?
As for the follow me eyes, I haven't seen any in use yet, but I have seen them in haunted houses and such and can understand if they make some people uneasy.? Perhaps you could add something else to draw attention away from the eyes?? If the eyes are very large and prominent I would bet the following effect is heightened and subsequently more unsettling.
?
Good luck!

I've felt this uncanny valley thing before too lol -I think that our "toonyness" factor in the fursuit database search is an indication of it also. ?It's sorta like the more realistic the fursuit, the less likely you are to evoke an "awww you made him cry" or such response from people when interacting but then again the more realistic suits seem not generally used for those public entertainment purposes but are a helluva lot more impressive at fur cons ;)
I had lots of friends say they get the creeps from the follow-me eyes when I was building Scape (I really dig them though;) so I made them slight and they turned out ok. -Jeeze along those lines, people get creeped out by goat and horse eyes in general so that was a bit of a challenge too.
Anyways -North puppy has really cool eyes that have that?shiny?reflective look. ?It seems you could get that effect if you used lenses from some form of eye protection -would want to make sure whatever plastic you use is made specifically for vision though since it is hard enough to see through?buckram?fursuit eyes as it is lol

I just returned from seeing Wall-E, and the thought crossed my mind... how do the animators at Pixar avoid the "uncanny valley" effect so prevalent with the 3D or "follow-me" eyes in fursuit head?? (link here for an explanation of the uncanny valley, if you're not familiar with the concept: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)? Especially with a robot character such as Wall-E, it could be easy to run into the uncanny valley.? Wall-E's eyes are partly sunken into his well, not his head, but into his camera-thingy, and covering that is an outer lens, which conveys some of the sparkle seen in a human or animal eye.? Extending this to suit heads, could a similar arrangement be used with 3D eyes (with the pupil and iris sunken back as usual, but a "lens", of plastic or what have you), or has something along those lines already been done or attempted?

I think due to the fact that The Incredibles were superheroes, and therefore disliked and distanced from non-superhumans in the film, helps to remove the valley effect. Also, Pixar always makes their characters extremely off the wall and exagerated. Mr Incredible's chin for example. 

The Hedgie

-----------------------------------------

I think the fact that character's in pixar films like wall-e and toy story don't think they are human to a high degree helps mitigate any effects that the uncanny valley may produce.  ie: because wall-e recognizes that he himself is a robot not a human, humans' who watch the film will be ok with it.

That's all i can come up with and it certainly doesn't explain the lack of a valley effect in movies like The Incredibles.

I think  a great deal comes from the actual positioning of the eyes as well.

alot of the newer fursuits that have the "3d" eyes tend to come out
abit "crossied" in expression..and that can add to the "oddness"

The first reason is that, visually, the Incredibles aren't human-like 
enough to be in the valley. Think about body proportions, skin texture, 
movements, and actions. They're exagerated intentionally to stay away 
from the valley. Imagine their costumes at Disney. Would they be the 
clothes+makeup of Snow White or Captain Jack Sparrow, or a full-body 
deal like Mickey Mouse or the dwarves?

Skin texture is a biggie. In the commentary of Shrek, they actually did 
get a perfect recreation of human skin (which is partially translucent 
in layers) for Princess Fiona, but backed away from it to keep things 
more toony.

None of this, however, is the issue with Wall-E, because he's nowhere 
near resembling an undead corpse (almost fully human and in the middle 
of the valley)

The other issue is posture and body language. Imagine if Mr. Incredible 
walked like a marionette, legs moving independant of the rest of the 
body. Part of what makes zombies creepy is that they move in a way that 
they (Ie, human beings) typically don't. Pixar's good about making the 
characters move 'naturally'.

(A recent article discusses the body language they worked out for 
Wall-E, as well as body language of the camera among other things. [ 
http://mag.awn.com/?ltype=pageone&article_no=3682 ] )

In the case of recessed eyes, I figure it's a case of 'tracking'. 
Imagine someone looking straight ahead all the time. Kinda creepy, 
unless mitigated by body language. That's with no recessing.

But what's also creepy is someone that stares straight at you no matter 
where they're facing. That's with the eyes fully recessed like on the 
inside of a sphere.

So with the eyes only slightly recessed, it's not a full-on stare, but 
does have some tracking. Of course, a disembodied head in general is 
also kind of creepy, but that's where the performer comes in. The same 
costume can be creepy or fun depending on if the character is moving 
appropriately.

Wow, was I long-winded. But does that make sense?

OK im upset.
well, more like annoyed.
ok... impatient. fine? lol

I emailed MixedCandy.com on July 1st at 7am.
The day their web site said they were opening their doors again.
I got 1 email saying they could not do silver fur, only grey.
I immediately replied another idea of lightly airbrushing silver over a Lt. grey fur.
I just got a response of "We are currently closed for commission. But we will re-open October 2008 to fill our January-March 2010 completion spots. If you are still interested email us in October."
?
I know.
Anything can happen in life.
But it's not like they are the only fursuit maker.
And i'm ready to have it started now.
?
So are there any other web site suggestions for a commission from pro-sketches?
Quaylak did a fantastic job!!!

Any 1st hand testimonials with pics?
?
Just as mixedcandy has their payment policy
I am ready to pay 1/3 (via paypal) of anywhere between $2000 & $3000

 I have similar thoughts about Luskwood.org? as I had some of their Avatars on Second Life and would like to commission one from them based on one of the AVs I had. Especially a Shadow Jogauni.

I would suggest against airbrushing silver over grey as it could be work 
intensive, and it might be better to just buy and supply the material. 
I'm not sure if such fur is made, or how expensive it is, but it's worth 
researching. Your mileage may vary.

The one I've been pointed to is FursuitAuctions on LJ. But you'll 
probably also get some good suggestions here from the makers 
themselves.

I hate to ask this, but is the watermarking really necessary? To those 
who simply want to view it, it's insulting to treat us like copyright 
infringers. To anyone who would want to use the costume idea, the 
watermark doesn't stop them from "Silver vixen with blond hair".

Other things you might want to consider is how you want things like 
digigrade legs designed, since there's a lot of tradeoffs in turning a 
drawing into something actually wearable.

Hope this helps.

?Hello, I would suggest www.furrhappens.com also. I just got s black and silver wolf from them and the silver on it looks great. The silver were only highlights to certain parts of the suit, but I like the way they did it and I premeiered it at AC this year. Raider.

OK im upset.



well, more like annoyed.
ok... impatient. fine? lol

I emailed MixedCandy.com on July 1st at 7am.
The day their web site said they were opening their doors again.
I got 1 email saying they could not do silver fur, only grey.
I immediately replied another idea of lightly airbrushing silver over a Lt. grey fur.
I just got a response of "We are currently closed for commission. But we will re-open October 2008 to fill our January-March 2010 completion spots. If you are still interested email us in October."
?
I know.
Anything can happen in life.
But it's not like they are the only fursuit maker.
And i'm ready to have it started now.
?
So are there any other web site suggestions for a commission from pro-sketches?
Quaylak did a fantastic job!!!

Any 1st hand testimonials with pics?
?
Just as mixedcandy has their payment policy
I am ready to pay 1/3 (via paypal) of anywhere between $2000 & $3000
?
only location I have the image online right now is here:
http://xae.xanga.com/3d1c74f737733189791720/z146015428.jpg
posted it on a message board a bit ago to show people.
otherwise, the full 5mb image can be immediately emailed
?
Anyone on the list here up for it?
Do they make silver fur?
?
PS: this may get double posted. sorry.
I forgot which email was associated with the list._______________________________________________

I would suggest looking at Joecifur at http://b3mascots.com Joecifur is a
cool guy.  His suits are toony and an excellent process at a great price.
He is filled up through March 2009 though, so if you want a suit from him,
email him and he may be able to put you on his list.

Hi All..

I was faced with a similar problem when making my wolf.  I wanted him to be
very lifelike, but the concept of making '3-D' eyes were a bit beyond me.

Another issue I found was more of a psychological issue. When people look at
another person they focus on the eyes.  This gives them a lot of feedback,
plus the blink mechanism stop the watcher from becoming a starer. Anthonmy
Hopkins found that when he playeed Hannible Lecter - he noticed that by
blinking at a much slower rate than notmal made him very sinister..

That is the issue with many costumes - they fool the watcher for a few
seconds but when there is no blick and the expression is static the
believability is lost. People will then insinctiviely look beyond the
costume to try and read the wearer's expressions etc.

I pondered about making a blink mechansim - but apart from pnuematics -
there is not much that is naturally fast, not even servo's are fast enought.
A spring loaded shutter mechanism might but they are very complex and
liabile not to last long in a fursuit that is not just for show.

What I ended up doing was using a set of sunglass lenses as the eyes. This
way they would hine my own eyes behind them. Then I glues a couple of
minature (3mm) Green LED's behind the lenses, blacked out behind so I would
not be dazzled by them.

These LED's were set on an electronic circuit that turned them on for about
1.5 secs, then of for 0.5 sec, and then back on.  To the watcher they
captured a 'blink', plus with a movable jaw I was able to express a realisim
that fooled a lot of people.

This circuit was based on a 555 timer, however I am redesigning it to use a
PICAXE micro controller. With the PICAXE I can vary the LED's brighness, and
duration of the blink.

Using a controlling system I should beable to Wink,  run the blinks as a
night time or day time brightness, and even  turn them on full for a number
of seconds like a STARE!!!


This coupled with some additional animatronics for muzzle flaps, nose
wrinles, ear movements, plus cheek and eyebrow - I should have a fursuit
head capable of running through a variety of  emotions and expressions.

Anyway - just my notes on how I solved an eye issue :>

It is also the way you act out in your suit.  Sure Marcwolf is realisitc -
but I can crouch down, play peek a boo with the kids (the eyelight really
come in handy there :>) and generaly act cute. Moving constantly like
looking around, movement of the warms and paws will also help a lot too.

Making larger movements like walking ithe a bit of a swagger, playing the
clown a bit (like begging at a table for food), and other antics - you
quickly get accross the feeling that you are harmless.


Walking slowly, making mor sinister moves, and fast unexpected movements can
make him look very creepy and suspisious.

Also - when in a suit - normal small movement are hidded. You need to do a
lot of exaduration to get your characters emotions through.

Just a couple of tips from a whitemuzzle

  I've felt this uncanny valley thing before too lol -I think that our
"toonyness" factor in the fursuit database search is an indication of it
also.  It's sorta like the more realistic the fursuit, the less likely you
are to evoke an "awww you made him cry" or such response from people when
interacting but then again the more realistic suits seem not generally used
for those public entertainment purposes but are a helluva lot more
impressive at fur cons ;)
  I had lots of friends say they get the creeps from the follow-me eyes when
I was building Scape (I really dig them though;) so I made them slight and
they turned out ok. -Jeeze along those lines, people get creeped out by goat
and horse eyes in general so that was a bit of a challenge too.
  Anyways -North puppy has really cool eyes that have that shiny reflective
look.  It seems you could get that effect if you used lenses from some form
of eye protection -would want to make sure whatever plastic you use is made
specifically for vision though since it is hard enough to see through
buckram fursuit eyes as it is lol

  I just returned from seeing Wall-E, and the thought crossed my mind... how
do the animators at Pixar avoid the "uncanny valley" effect so prevalent
with the 3D or "follow-me" eyes in fursuit head?  (link here for an
explanation of the uncanny valley, if you're not familiar with the concept:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)  Especially with a robot
character such as Wall-E, it could be easy to run into the uncanny valley.
Wall-E's eyes are partly sunken into his well, not his head, but into his
camera-thingy, and covering that is an outer lens, which conveys some of the
sparkle seen in a human or animal eye.  Extending this to suit heads, could
a similar arrangement be used with 3D eyes (with the pupil and iris sunken
back as usual, but a "lens", of plastic or what have you), or has something
along those lines already been done or attempted?

Thats right, just rub it in that your fursuit will always be better than
mine. =b

One of these days I will get down to Australia to visit you and maybe even
go fursuiting. But it might be more likely that you will get to the states
first.

--=={ New and improved website!! }==--


Through the hard work of Rama and Red Card we have a newly designed MFM 
website this year with lots of new features. Check out everything that's 
going on over there!

http://www.mephitfurmeet.org



--=={ Hotel Reservation Info, Rooms Going Fast! }==--


We will once again be in the Holiday Inn Select Memphis Airport, located at 
2240 Democrat Road, Memphis TN 38132-1807. The special Mephit Fur Meet rate 
is $99 per night for 1-4 people in the room. Rooms are available with one 
king size bed or 2 double beds and your choice of either smoking or 
nonsmoking. The layout of the hotel is perfect for MFM with the main level 
being on the 3rd floor of the hotel allowing everyone to be either on the 
main level or not more than 2 floors up or down. So it makes getting to 
panels, socializing in the Garden Court (a huge atrium area of the hotel) or 
fursuiting a breeze. You can book your room online at:

http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/sl/1/en/cwshome/DPRD-79FJRE/MEMDR/website/

or

Call 800-653-6524 or email mfmdirector at hotmail.com to make your reservation!

Don't wait till it's too late! Suites are already SOLD OUT!!


The hotel promises that they have a lot of the issues encountered worked out 
for this year. (remember we had a total staff change just a few weeks before 
the con!)


--=={ MFM Spirituality Track}==--


We are looking for panelists!  If you can share your expertise or you have 
resources you would like us to include in this year's topics, please contact 
us. I guarantee we'll have you working overtime.

Pshaw and I have been working hard implementing your suggestions from last 
year.  This year's focus will be Pan-Asian mythology.  We'll be looking at 
animal symbology and therianthropic connections in the literature of India, 
China, and Japan.  Almost everyone knows about the fox maidens and the 
raccoon pranksters but we'll be looking at some of the less recognized 
figures: phoenix, bat, chicken, and others.

Our mythological totem animal will be the eastern dragon.

This year we've also decided to add a new panel.  We will be discussing the 
mythology of a common animal and we've chosen the horse for the debut of 
this panel.

At your request, the meditation panel will be split into two separate 
panels, each an hour long. The first will be for those who don't know how to 
meditate or need a refresher.  We will explain the process, answer 
questions, and you can share your own experiences.  The second panel will be 
the guided meditation panel in which you'll be taken on a journey to 
possibly meet your totem animal.

We intend to continue the Christian furs round table but we need someone to 
coordinate the panel, come up with a topic, and lead it. We would also like 
to expand our offerings in this area.   A panel addressing the symbolic 
aspects of animal mythology in the Bible and the Christian faith has been 
suggested.  If you can volunteer your time, please contact us.

Pshaw will be hosting a panel which will show you how to make totem shrines 
out of common objects such as Altoids tins.

We are also trying to put together a panel about shapeshifting from the 
shamanic perspective.  If you can volunteer your experience, knowledge or 
resources, we need you.

We're look forward to seeing you at MFM 2008!

Brothers Brawl!

 So, come forward, gamers, make yourselves known either through

--=={ Registration }==--


We know it's all fun and games, but hey, we have to pay our bills too! 
That's where registration comes in. We strive to keep our prices low and 
have not had a price increase in over 6 years. We know you work hard to earn 
your money, so we try to give you the most bang for your con-going buck. Not 
only do we have a regular membership, but if you have some more money to 
spend and want to help out the convention, sign up for one of our higher 
levels. We'll even give you some nice thank you gifts for giving us your

--=={ Tiger Haven Auction }==--



For years Mephit Fur Meet has proudly hosted a charity auction with all 
proceeds going to Tiger Haven Sanctuary. Hikaru has done a wonderful job 
organizing this auction for years but has finally decided it is time to pass 
the torch, this year the auction will be run by Hikaru's once assistant, 
PrincessB.


I hope to make my first year a huge success but I have to have you for that! 
It is not too early to start looking for items you would like to donate. 
Without your donations this action would not be possible and that makes the 
big kitties sad! We are still looking for donations for this year's Tiger 
Haven Charity Auction. This can be art, commissions, clean plush, anything 
Furry related


Remember, this is not some faceless organization that you have no clue how 
much is really going to help the cats. The Tiger Haven ladies are there ever 
year able to answer any questions you have, and you can check out their 
website at www.TigerHaven.org

If you have any questions or will be unable to attend MFM but want to donate 
something for the action feel free to contact PrincessB and she will gladly 
help in any way she can.

Thank you for continuing to make The Tiger Haven Charity Auction a big 
success every year!


For even more info see http://www.mephitfurmeet.org/charity

heading up a panel, email the name and a brief description of your panel to 
our programming director, Maui.  Contact Information can be found at

--=={ LAN Gaming Information }==--


Once again this year, MFM will be featuring LAN gaming. Bring your machine 
and participate in a free-for-all-furry-fragfest! The LAN will have (at 
least) limited Megabit support this year. We'll also have some new games. 
Expect to see a lot of the newest games!  Requests are welcome. We are also 
planning a couple exhibition matches you won't want to miss.  More details 
on these in the near future.


--=={ Video Room }==--


The MFM Video Room, serving your Viewing Pleasure!

We had a lot of fun in 2007, showing all the Best in Furry vids and 
movies... and we're doing it again in 2008!  We will once again be having 
the "Viewers Choice" timeslots that allow you to Vote for the vids you want 
to see.  Some of these choices will be the Furry Classics, but some of them 
will be chosen from the Newest available movies!  We will also bring back 
the other Favored events from previous years, which include "Film @ Eleven", 
"Weird Stuff found on the Web", "Fans & Freaks" - which was partially filmed 
at MFM, and (of course!) "Meet the Feebles".  So check those Schedules, and 
stop in the Video Room once again to see what Great Furry Vids we are 
showing for your
viewing enjoyment!


--=={ Video Room }==--


Here is a short synopsis of what I had planned for this year's Meet:

1. The Thursday Night Open Call Show is once again planned, with lots of new 
music, puppets, and performers. .

2. "Who's Puppet is it Anyway" is also arranged. Just like the TV show, 
puppeteers will act out a series of funny themes and actions. Last year, the 
puppeteers had a blast, as did the audience.

3. Panels:

One on "Behind the scenes", where a beginning puppeteer can see how the 
stage, sound, and video is set up. Also, give tips on performing behind the 
stage.


Another panel will be about "Beginning Puppeteering: You have a Puppet...Now 
what?" This panel will include basic 'how to' tips and techniques: how to 
animate the puppet, how to lip synch, how to come up with a short script, 
etc.

--=={ MFM Masquerade }==--


"I'm also going to need to have you come in ... on Sunday."

Yes, that's right, it's time to start thinking about the Masquerade at 
Mephit Fur Meet.  Now's the time to start coming up with ideas.  Remember 
that there is a Theme award, and this years theme is "Office Space."  The 
other thing people might not have known from last year, is that there is 
sign up for the Masq on Friday night.  I do have cookies there for those 
that sign up early.  It helps me find out if we need to find filler.  If you 
don't have an act, I am planning on having a script or two available, if I 
can convince the
right people.  There will be more details along the way.


--=={ Dance/Karaoke Information }==--


Can you DJ?  Can you spell DJ?  Do you know someone named DJ?

The MFM dances are being 'regrooved' this year.  You wanted more 'party' 
type music and less 'rave' so we're looking for talented DJ's to play at 
this year's convention.  Experience with rock, roll, pop, house and disco is 
strongly preferred.   Amateur and
professionals are equally encouraged to submit an audition mix to 
sumatrae98 at yahoo.com.  Selections will be made in the Spring.  If you've 
already submitted, you don't have to do it again.


--=={ Share Your Interests With Others }==--


MFM recognizes the diversity in interests among its attendees.   In an 
effort to provide folks with special interests with a place to meet and 
greet, MFM will allow groups to make use of its unused space, free of cost, 
to its attendees.   For more information, please contact Tyger Cowboy.  This 
will be provided on a 'first come, first served' basis.


--=={ Mailing Lists }==--


General chat for those interested in or attending MFM 2005 can be found at 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mfm-chat

We also have direct mailing lists for news and related posts regarding MFM.

The brain really _wants_ to see a blink, doesn't it!

Zuki's cyber-gargoyle suit has glowing green eyes (vision is
through the tear ducts) that were lit all the time.  The head
developed an intermittent connection causing the LEDs to briefly
extinguish, and gave the appearance of blinking.  Many people
thought it was deliberate as it got rid of the stare, but it
just turned out the original build had connections were made
of twisted wire.

I soldered all the connections and them built him a little PIC
based blink circuit.  Details here:

Last time I checked, this place is overpriced for what they give you.  
They do have a huge variety, but most of the fur's cheap quality, and 
the prices are not.

A well-planned trip down to the LA fasion district will get you much 
better results.  It's a much longer drive, but if you can find a weekend 
for it, you'll find much better prices and much better quality fur.  I 
forget the names of the good places down there...maybe someone else can 
pitch in with those.

-Uck!

there will be any left!!!!


We will once again be in the Holiday Inn Select Memphis Airport, located at 
2240 Democrat Road, Memphis TN 38132-1807. The special Mephit Fur Meet rate 
is $99 per night for 1-4 people in the room. Rooms are available with one 
king size bed or 2 double beds and your choice of either smoking or 
nonsmoking. The layout of the hotel is perfect for MFM with the main level 
being on the 3rd floor of the hotel allowing everyone to be either on the 
main level or not more than 2 floors up or down. So it makes getting to 
panels, socializing in the Garden Court (a huge atrium area of the hotel) or 
fursuiting a breeze. You can book your room online at:

http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/sl/1/en/cwshome/DPRD-79FJRE/MEMDR/website/

or

Call 800-653-6524 or email mfmdirector at hotmail.com to make your reservation!

Don't wait till it's too late! Suites are already SOLD OUT!!


The hotel promises that they have a lot of the issues encountered worked out 
for this year. (remember we had a total staff change just a few weeks before 
the con!)


--=={ MFM Spirituality Track}==--


We are looking for panelists!  If you can share your expertise or you have 
resources you would like us to include in this year's topics, please contact 
us. I guarantee we'll have you working overtime.

Pshaw and I have been working hard implementing your suggestions from last 
year.  This year's focus will be Pan-Asian mythology.  We'll be looking at 
animal symbology and therianthropic connections in the literature of India, 
China, and Japan.  Almost everyone knows about the fox maidens and the 
raccoon pranksters but we'll be looking at some of the less recognized 
figures: phoenix, bat, chicken, and others.

Our mythological totem animal will be the eastern dragon.

This year we've also decided to add a new panel.  We will be discussing the 
mythology of a common animal and we've chosen the horse for the debut of 
this panel.

At your request, the meditation panel will be split into two separate 
panels, each an hour long. The first will be for those who don't know how to 
meditate or need a refresher.  We will explain the process, answer 
questions, and you can share your own experiences.  The second panel will be 
the guided meditation panel in which you'll be taken on a journey to 
possibly meet your totem animal.

We intend to continue the Christian furs round table but we need someone to 
coordinate the panel, come up with a topic, and lead it. We would also like 
to expand our offerings in this area.   A panel addressing the symbolic 
aspects of animal mythology in the Bible and the Christian faith has been 
suggested.  If you can volunteer your time, please contact us.

Pshaw will be hosting a panel which will show you how to make totem shrines 
out of common objects such as Altoids tins.

We are also trying to put together a panel about shapeshifting from the 
shamanic perspective.  If you can volunteer your experience, knowledge or 
resources, we need you.

We're look forward to seeing you at MFM 2008!


--=={ Gaming Information }==--

we're going to offer you the chance to run games and potentially earn

in running a game or gaming event at MFM, please send a  note to 
jarrodhenry at gmail.com and talk about what game you want to  run.  ALSO!  If

spend and want to help out the convention, sign up for one of our higher

--=={ Tiger Haven Auction }==--



For years Mephit Fur Meet has proudly hosted a charity auction with all 
proceeds going to Tiger Haven Sanctuary. Hikaru has done a wonderful job 
organizing this auction for years but has finally decided it is time to pass 
the torch, this year the auction will be run by Hikaru's once assistant, 
PrincessB.


I hope to make my first year a huge success but I have to have you for that! 
It is not too early to start looking for items you would like to donate. 
Without your donations this action would not be possible and that makes the 
big kitties sad! We are still looking for donations for this year's Tiger 
Haven Charity Auction. This can be art, commissions, clean plush, anything 
Furry related


Remember, this is not some faceless organization that you have no clue how 
much is really going to help the cats. The Tiger Haven ladies are there ever 
year able to answer any questions you have, and you can check out their 
website at www.TigerHaven.org

If you have any questions or will be unable to attend MFM but want to donate 
something for the action feel free to contact PrincessB and she will gladly 
help in any way she can.

Thank you for continuing to make The Tiger Haven Charity Auction a big 
success every year!


For even more info see http://www.mephitfurmeet.org/charity


--=={ Programming }==--


Want to share your knowledge? If you would like to take on the task of 
heading up a panel, email the name and a brief description of your panel to 
our programming director, Maui.  Contact Information can be found at 
http://www.mephitfurmeet.org/programming


--=={ LAN Gaming Information }==--


Once again this year, MFM will be featuring LAN gaming. Bring your machine 
and participate in a free-for-all-furry-fragfest! The LAN will have (at 
least) limited Megabit support this year. We'll also have some new games. 
Expect to see a lot of the newest games!  Requests are welcome. We are also 
planning a couple exhibition matches you won't want to miss.  More details 
on these in the near future.


--=={ Video Room }==--


The MFM Video Room, serving your Viewing Pleasure!

We had a lot of fun in 2007, showing all the Best in Furry vids and 
movies... and we're doing it again in 2008!  We will once again be having 
the "Viewers Choice" timeslots that allow you to Vote for the vids you want 
to see.  Some of these choices will be the Furry Classics, but some of them 
will be chosen from the Newest available movies!  We will also bring back 
the other Favored events from previous years, which include "Film @ Eleven", 
"Weird Stuff found on the Web", "Fans & Freaks" - which was partially filmed 
at MFM, and (of course!) "Meet the Feebles".  So check those Schedules, and 
stop in the Video Room once again to see what Great Furry Vids we are 
showing for your
viewing enjoyment!


--=={ Video Room }==--


Here is a short synopsis of what I had planned for this year's Meet:

1. The Thursday Night Open Call Show is once again planned, with lots of new 
music, puppets, and performers. .

2. "Who's Puppet is it Anyway" is also arranged. Just like the TV show, 
puppeteers will act out a series of funny themes and actions. Last year, the 
puppeteers had a blast, as did the audience.

3. Panels:

One on "Behind the scenes", where a beginning puppeteer can see how the 
stage, sound, and video is set up. Also, give tips on performing behind the 
stage.


Another panel will be about "Beginning Puppeteering: You have a Puppet...Now 
what?" This panel will include basic 'how to' tips and techniques: how to 
animate the puppet, how to lip synch, how to come up with a short script, 
etc.

--=={ MFM Masquerade }==--


"I'm also going to need to have you come in ... on Sunday."

Yes, that's right, it's time to start thinking about the Masquerade at 
Mephit Fur Meet.  Now's the time to start coming up with ideas.  Remember 
that there is a Theme award, and this years theme is "Office Space."  The 
other thing people might not have known from last year, is that there is 
sign up for the Masq on Friday night.  I do have cookies there for those 
that sign up early.  It helps me find out if we need to find filler.  If you 
don't have an act, I am planning on having a script or two available, if I 
can convince the
right people.  There will be more details along the way.


--=={ Dance/Karaoke Information }==--


Can you DJ?  Can you spell DJ?  Do you know someone named DJ?

The MFM dances are being 'regrooved' this year.  You wanted more 'party' 
type music and less 'rave' so we're looking for talented DJ's to play at 
this year's convention.  Experience with rock, roll, pop, house and disco is 
strongly preferred.   Amateur and
professionals are equally encouraged to submit an audition mix to 
sumatrae98 at yahoo.com.  Selections will be made in the Spring.  If you've 
already submitted, you don't have to do it again.


--=={ Share Your Interests With Others }==--


MFM recognizes the diversity in interests among its attendees.   In an 
effort to provide folks with special interests with a place to meet and 
greet, MFM will allow groups to make use of its unused space, free of cost, 
to its attendees.   For more information, please contact Tyger Cowboy.  This 
will be provided on a 'first come, first served' basis.


--=={ Mailing Lists }==--


General chat for those interested in or attending MFM 2005 can be found at 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mfm-chat

We also have direct mailing lists for news and related posts regarding MFM.

<Laughs>

Hey - Done that already.  Except I use 5v and mine flash at a standard blink
rate.

One of the things I found with many costumes is that when you look at the
heads - you get very little visual feedback. So I mounted a couple of small
green led's where the pupils would be and set then to flash like a reverse
blink  1.5sec On, .5 Sec Off.

It work very well as it hold's people attention to the character.

It's on my Website  http://marcwolf.org

Enjoy

Dave

I like what I did. My eyes are the suits eyes. You cant get more realistic
than that! Also you have the best vision of any fursuit and you get more of
the I am the character feeling.

	website states as "Catch a wave and hang-ten off the shores of a
	Polynesian isle, or hit the beach and grab a mojito under the palm
	trees, listening to the call of tropical birds." So think of surfing
	films, hanging out at the beach and having a cool drink.
- Poems, or Essays should also fit the theme as well.
- Art can be either black and white or color. We can print both. For
	specifications and templates for the Con Book, please see the website
	here: http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/policies/conbook
- Stories and Poems are limited to three pages of text.
- The Deadline will be October 1st, 2008
- To submit art, stories and poems, simply send an email with your art,
	stories and poems to: conbook at furtherconfusion.org with the subject line
	of Conbook Contest and please include your real name, your fan name, an
	email address and a website (if you have one), so we can get a hold of
	you as well as publish the information in the con book.


5. The Program Book Needs You!

With the initial deadline for the con book less than a month and a half
away, things are already coming down to the wire -- but as yet there's
very little content in hand: no artwork, no fiction or poetry, no
advertisements, and almost no editorial. For outside submissions,
particularly illustrations and writing, staffers are encouraged to remind
artist and writer friends that their works would be most welcome!
Editorial, of course, is generated internally, and any staffer who wants
to know what material is still outstanding is encouraged to e-mail
conbook at furtherconfusion.org for a list of needed items and a PDF file
containing the con-book specs.

6. Furry Market Place

Furry Market Place space sales opened on August 1st and already half the
spaces have been sold. But that doesn't mean you've missed your chance.
Just head on over to the Furry Market Place page on the Further Confusion
website at:

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/dealers/market-place>

And download your application form. Print it out, fill it out, and send it
along with a check for US$65.00 made out to FURTHER CONFUSION, and YOU can
sell your wares (with certain restrictions, see the website for details)
at the convention. And yes, that $65 includes a full membership to the
convention at no additional charge.

Get yours NOW while the surf is still up!


7. Events

FC2009 Events has now kicked off its panel drive. If you have any panel
suggestions, want to volunteer for panels, or would like to volunteer to
be panelists for our various tracks, please email us at
events at furtherconfusion.org with your questions and comments.

If you would like to work for Events, we do still have some track lead
positions open for FC2009. We are looking to hire an Art Track Lead, a
Science/Technology Track Lead and a Fursuit Track lead as well as gaming
staff and creator's lounge staff. Should you be interested in any of these
positions, please contact hr at furtherconfusion.org.

Let's make FC2009 something really special!


8. Supporting/Non Attending Membership

Further Confusion is introducing a new membership type for 2009, called
the Supporting/Non-attending Membership. This membership type is for those
who want to support Further Confusion, but who are unable to make it to
the convention. This type does qualify as a Further Confusion membership
(and allows participation in the FC 2009 Art Show, which requires a
membership), but does not allow attending the convention itself. You will
receive a convention packet (including con book) by mail after the
convention.


9. We need iMacs

If you have an old (300MHz or faster) iMac sitting around that you do not
need, let us know. Drop an email to con-it at furtherconfusion.org. We need
them for various things around the convention, mostly in registration and
artshow.


10. Badge Art Wanted

Further Confusion is currently seeking artwork submissions for the 2009
membership badge inserts. Both color and black & white artwork will be
accepted, and all artwork will be considered on overall 'look and feel',
plus these additional points:

- Size: Art must scale to be printed at 4" x 2".
- Theme: Art must accurately reflect the theme of the con.
- Age appropriateness: The art must be suitable for viewing by children.

Artists submitting images should be aware that there is no payment for
badge art chosen, and the artist gives Further Confusion the right to
reproduce the image as badge art for FC2009. The artist will be credited
on the insert and in the con program book. The artist retains all other
copyrights and reproduction rights beyond the above.

Submission deadline is November 1st, 2008. All qualifying submissions will
be seriously considered and we will choose 6 designs. All artists will be
notified by December 1st as to whether or not their submissions have been
chosen.

Submission technical specs: We prefer JPG format at best possible quality
compression, at 300 DPI. An 8" by 4" original scanned at 300DPI gives us a
good file to work with. Badge art Submissions should be sent to
badgeartsubmissions at furtherconfusion.org. In the email specify how you
wish to be credited should your art be chosen.


11. Traveling from overseas? 

Are you coming to Further Confusion from Australia, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, or any other country
that are part of the US Visa Waiver program? This is the program where you
fill in one of those little green cards that you have to keep in your
passport and then return to US Immigration when leaving.

The US Department of Homeland Security has introduce a new wrinkle for
people from those countries. You now must apply for a "Pre-Travel
Authorization" no less than 72 hours before departing for the US. While
this system is currently voluntary, it will be mandatory starting on
January 12, 2009. Because this will directly affect our members from
overseas, we are doing our best to spread the word about this now so that
no-one is caught out.

You can apply for this travel authorization online at
<https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/>

A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page is also available at
<http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/esta/esta_faq.xml>

If it makes you feel any better, even your chairman for FC2009 has to do
this. 


12. Next Staff Meeting

Our next staff meeting will be on September 20th, starting at 1pm in the
San Jose DoubleTree hotel. Parking is free - we will be providing stickers
at the meeting which will allow the parking staff to know you were with
Further Confusion, and let you out without needing to pay.

**************************************
Morphicon Freefall Picnic (September 27th, 2008)

This year's annual FREE picnic will be held, as usual, at Sharon Woods 
Metro Park. This year we'll be meeting up on September 27th. Morphicon 
will be providing the fire, the meat, and the drinks as well as eating 
utensils. Feel free to bring some extras like baked beans, or the ever 
popular potatoes salad. You don't have to bring anything but yourself 
and your appetite. Directions, the park's address, and the park's 
website are included below.

We should have a covered shelter, so look for furries with ears and 
tails congregating if you're trying to find us. Everyone is welcome at 
the annual Morphicon picnic, we've even had a few out of state visitors. 
So don't be shy, stop on by!

North on exit 27, Cleveland Avenue exit. Park is on the left in a 1/2 mile

**************************************
New Chair

For those of you who haven't already heard, Max Goof has stepped down as 
the Morphicon Chair. We'd like to send him a big THANK YOU for all his 
tireless efforts to keep the convention on track and running smoothly 
during his tenure. He'll be dearly missed.

The board has appointed Jewel to fill in his overly large shoes. He 
hopes to bring the same service, commitment to quality, and small con 
feel to Morphicon this year that you've come to expect.

**************************************
GOH Selection and 2009 Theme

The Morphicon theme for 2009 is Inner City Critters. We hope to 
incorporate some fun events at the convention that represent the diverse 
lifestyles of those animals that live in the concrete jungle.

We're also proud to announce that Joey-Poey has accepted our invitation 
to be a GoH for Morphicon 2009. Joey fits in nicely with our 2009 theme. 
You can see why at his fur affinity page.

**************************************
Morphicon Staff Recruitment Drive!

Morphicon is growing each and every year, but our staff is only getting 
older! We're always looking for new faces, and fresh blood, to flesh out 
the ranks. If you're interested in volunteering your time for Morphicon, 
we'd like to hear from you. We're tentatively looking for people with 
interest in any of the following positions. Staffers receive a free 
basic level registration at the convention. No experience is required, 
but that's always a plus!

Outreach: Organizing local events, pride parade, picnic, bowling trips, 
movie outings, etc.

Publicity: Managing flyer swaps, purchasing ad space, ensuring flyers 
are displayed at other furry conventions, and distributing newsletters.

Registration: Processing registrations both at the door and before the 
convention, handling cash, handling receipts, working with registration 
database.

Treasurer: Handling receipts, writing checks, issuing basic reports on 
income and expenses. CPA credentials or real world experience are a big 
plus.

Don't fret if none of these positions are what you're looking for, but 
you're still enthusiastic about helping out with the convention, send an 
e-mail to Jewel (chair AT morphicon.org) and we'll see what we can do. 
We're always interested in hearing from potential volunteers.

I crafted a nose from foam rubber and then wrapped it in faux  
leather.  Wrapping it also let me put folds in the nostrils, making it  
look a little more real.

well you could also try using super sculpy then pleather over it. with the
shape of the nose figured out with the sculpy its easy to make the pleather
fold in a way that looks real, like a real nose kinda like what Blackberry
suggested.

I did the same on a recent suit head, but used stretch PVC fabric instead of
pleather.  It gives the nose a nice and shiny, "wet" look that I think looks
pretty real.  If sewing's your thing, you could also just sew the nose and
stuff it with poly-fill.

I can't think of any specific ones at the moment, but I'm currently trying
this method with a nose on a new suit I'm doing, so if you want, I could
send pics of it in-progress.

Hey all,
 
I've tried stretch pvc, and it works yes, however try this method.
 
Instead of tooldip, I use silicon modified acylic membrane which can be tinted  in a range of colours.
 
ASTEC paints in Australia has it on their site, I'm in south OZ. 
 
I shape my nose out of PE30 closed cell foam and them using a Bauer 3D sander (google it cause it's a wicked tool. I only use 1 Head though "ha, ha", it's got 3 30mm sanding disks on it!!!) I shape and smooth the nose with 1200 grit paper and then spray 5 coats of silicon over the top and then 1 final coat of airbrush flexible urethane gloss to finish.
 
Very cost effectine, $50 for 4 litres of white or black then you can tint it yourself with acrlicic paint. thin down with water cause it waterbased and wont cause you harm, (we hope)
 
Pity I don't trust myself furring heads yet!!!
 
Cheers ,
 
Luke.

Message-ID: <BB37FBF6-CEFC-4ECB-8B06-BA812050DF16@thefoxden.com>

Just to clarify a few of the list rules...

Posting to this list to advertise a fursuit related event is  
appropriate.  So advertising a fursuit bowling, or a fursuit dinner   
are allowed.  Advertisement for events that have fursuiters (Like  
furry cons)  is also allowed, as long as it's not more than like a  
monthly post for the same event to this list.

What is not appropriate is anyone flaming anyone on the list directly  
accusing them of innapropriate content.  If someone has an issue with  
content posted on this list, you may bring it up with me, or you may  
choose to unsubscribe.  If I hear of anyone harrasing members of this  
list for contributing content..  I will remove that person.  This  
list is to share ideas, and discuss fursuit related events,  
construction and performance.

This is all I have to say for the moment..

Message-ID: <201e9a6e0809180941s77091f20i67e44919b606a5d4@mail.gmail.com>

Rainfurrest 2009 "Flight" opens in Seattle Washington in a little more than
one week.  I'd like to invite anyone on this list who's planning to attend
to participate in our furry variety show on Saturday night!

One of my favorite parts of fursuiting is getting to entertain and play in
front of a friendly audience of furry fans, and this year it looks like
we're going to have a big audience ready to see a silly, fun show.  Last
year we had 370 fans and 41 fursuiters in the parade.  Based on
pre-registrations this year, it looks like we'll have at least 50% more.

If you'd like to be in the show, please contact me right away at
northing at gmail.com.  I even have some skit and song ideas, so if the only
thing holding you back is writer's block I can help you!

Our inaugural in 2007 was great,  but this year is going to be spectacular!
I'm really excited about how far we've stepped up.   Our new atrium-style
hotel will be dressed as a furry airport ready to meet flying
fur adventurers from all over the globe.  At Curbside Check-in
(Registration) everyfur will be drawn into the high flying spirit of
aviation with a themed gift, their tickets for the weekend, and a friendly
Northwest welcome to Seattle.  You might even see a familiar brown puppy in
aviator's garb!

And that's just the launch of what promises to be a really special weekend
in the furry world.  I'd like to see some more suiters having fun in our
show, so if you are coming please don't miss out!  And in any case, at least
make sure you come up and say "hi!" I'll be giving out free hugs all
weekend!

Fly High!

I think Lionel from Lion of the Sun has some of that.  I know he has the 
camera vision system and I think ear movement.  Take a look at his site 
or drop him an email.  I know he has wanted to do more and has the skill 
set to pull it off.

Message-ID: <OMEIJPJAFKIANLCOEJOIOEFJHBAA.marcwolf@marcwolf.org>

Actually I am doing a bit in designing some animatronics for my costume.

I have not posted anything along those lines for a while because a couple of
them are in development.. But I am working on a fully automonious wearable
animatronic control system for a suit wearer.

Think Underworld Werewolf gestures  controlled with a spoken word by the
wearer..

Basically it is an HM2007 speech recognition system that watches the users
speech patterns for control words (the system is trainable). When it finds a
valid control word it sends an instruction to the command processor

The Command processor is an SD21 servo controller with a PICAXE 18X in it.
When the PICAXE recieves a control word (a number between 1 and 10) it opens
a file on a USB drive named the same as the command. The USB in interfaced
to the PICAXE with a VDRIVE2 module.

The USB drive contains all of the sequences for the servos timelined at
500ms.  I map in the servo position each 500ms - is anyone does Audio or
Vidio preparation they will know what I mean :>

The servo positions are read in and transferred via I2C bus to the SD21
internal processor which takes care of the movement and houskeeping of the
servos.

The PICAXE also does several housekeeping functions. It can read the battery
state.  All servo groups can be turned on and off  by the PICAXE so that
functionaly can be gracefully degraded as battery power lowers... to the
point where the whole system can turn itself off to keep the Fans going for
the suit wearer.

Cost is still up in the air as I am in development HOWEVER I can give you
this info.

HM2007 Kit  $115
http://www.imagesco.com/speech/speech-recognition-technology.html
VDrive2        $40       http://www.vinculum.com/prd_vdrive1.html
SD21           $60
http://www.acroname.com/robotics/parts/R240-SD21.html

Various chips etc  inc PICAXE  about  $50  http://www.rev-ed.co.uk/picaxe/
or US supplier http://www.advancedmicrocircuits.com/cart/ or
http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/categories.php

Batteries (I have a backpack that fits on my spine - 6 x 11000mAh D cells
giving 8volts)  about $80  (I am planning to drop a cell to give a about 7V)



Whats is a PICAXE you may ask.. Well - many of you have heard of the
BASICStamp.. Well the PICAXE is essentially the same except a lot lot
cheaper. You program it in BASIC using the free compiler from the supplier..
you down load your code.. and it works.
The chips are very cheap from about $5.50 for the smallest to about $27.00
for the largest (a 40 pin device with tonnes of inputs and outputs).
If you want to play with animatronics I could not recommend a cheaper and
fun way to do it.

For example - my tail wagger circuit was the base PICAXE 08M kit
http://world-educational-services.net/cart/index.php?main_page=product_info&
cPath=7_14_21&products_id=6&zenid=028184ff6880c6f108193b6350522193
Which was  $12.95.  That included the board, the programming cable, CD rom
.. EVERYTHING.

Then add in a Servo for experimentation  about the same..  Load the
programming software onto your computer and program away..  You can have the
tail wagging going in about 3 lines of code.

For the more technically minded - a Servo works  with a pulse between 1us
and 2us. Once ser the servo requires this pulse to be sent every 20ms
otherwise the servo will turn off.  The picake does all of this housekeeping
for you

10 Servo 1, 5
20 Servo 1, 200
30 goto 10

Once the servo command is issued then the PICAXE will continue to keep the
servo live as long as wyou want.. Just set and forget.


Take care.. and any questions you know how to get in contact with me :> :>

5.  Travel Assistance Program.

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/policies/travel-assistance>

Each year, we have some folks who need a little bit of extra help in
affording the trip to Further Confusion. This is your chance to help them
out. The folks listed on this page are folks who have specifically
requested help from the fandom and are people we feel are worthy of your
consideration.

If you need just a little help in getting to Further Confusion 2009, we're
here for you! FC can offer travel assistance to those in need. Just e-
mail us at info at furtherconfusion.org (with 'Travel Assistance' in the
subject line), and we'll add you to the list below.

When e-mailing us, make sure that you include your real name, fan name,
mailing address, and provide a brief description about yourself and what
you feel you can contribute to the convention. Note that the deadline for
getting on to the travel assistance list is October 1, 2008.

If you want to make a donation to the convention to help a specific
person, here's how you do it. Send us a check (our address is listed on
our Contact page: <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/contact>) with
the name of the individual listed in the memo field of the check (or money
order, as the case may be). We will deposit that check into our accounts,
and in after the request deadline, we will notify the person of the amount
received on their behalf. We will NOT reveal the names of persons who have
made such contributions unless both the recipient and the donor desire us
to.


6.  The Program Book Still Needs Your Submissions!

With the initial deadline for the con book is October 1st, so things are
right down to the wire -- but as yet there's very little artwork, a single
advertisement, and almost no editorial. For illustrations, staffers are
encouraged to remind artist friends that their works would be most
welcome! Editorial, of course, is generated internally, and any staffer
who wants to know what material is still outstanding is encouraged to
e-mail conbook at furtherconfusion.org for a list of needed items and a PDF
file containing the con-book specs.


7.  Convention Book Art and Story Contest

FC2009 is proud to present a Con Book Art and Story contest. We will
randomly select two art winners and one story winner from all of the
entries, and each one of those winners will receive a Patron Level
membership to FC2009. The Con Book editor will then decide who gets
published in our Con Book form among all the entries,winners or not.

Deadline is October 1st!

A Patrons membership to FC2009 includes:
- A Free FC2009 t-shirt
- Admittance to our Catered Patron lunch with our Guests of Honor
- Cool Goodies such as our limited edition convention lapel pin and  other
	gifts
- The ever so cool Patron badge.

The Rules
- Each artist and author is limited to one entry per person.
- Art , Stories and Poems have to be PG rated. No exceptions.
- Art should fit the theme of FC2009, which is "Surf Safari". Which  our
	website states as "Catch a wave and hang-ten off the shores of a
	Polynesian isle, or hit the beach and grab a mojito under the palm
	trees, listening to the call of tropical birds." So think of surfing
	films, hanging out at the beach and having a cool drink.
- Poems, or Essays should also fit the theme as well.

For more information, please email conbook at furtherconfusion.org


8.  Spirituality at Further Confusion

This year Blackfeather will be helping to coordinate spirituality events at
FC.  He'd like as much input as possible from you, the attendees, as it is
your convention! For events to get listed in the actual program book they
must be in soon, next week in fact.  If you have an idea for a panel or
other activity or event, please email him at events at furtherconfusion.org

So far he has an open roundtable discussion and an atheists' and
agnostics' discussion on spirituality.

and 90's.  Saturday night, the best of popular electronic dance music
(ie., house, trance, electro, breaks, etc.)  Sunday night, is up in the
air, probably including the best dance music that doesn't fit on the other
nights.

Submissions should be in MP3 format, and showing both your taste and style
in track selection, as well as your ability to seamlessly mix music and
keep the flow moving. Send an email to dances at furtherconfusion.org
and include your real name, fan name, type of media you use (CDs, Vinyl,
Laptop), type of genre(s) you play, link to MP3 demo, and any other
information you feel pertinent.

We will be accepting demo's until October 31st, and will put together a
schedule shortly after that and notifying all the DJs.

Also, we will be bringing back the "Live! Action! Drawing!" during the
dances.  We set up a large easel up on the stage with a spotlight so
everyone can see, provide you with paper and implementations, and give you
roughly an hour or so to draw as you are being inspired by everything
going on around you.  Interested in this?  Also email
dances at furtherconfusion.org


11. Next Staff Meeting

Our next staff meeting will be on October 18th, starting at 1pm in the
San Jose DoubleTree hotel. Parking is free - we will be providing stickers
at the meeting which will allow the parking staff to know you were with
Further Confusion, and let you out without needing to pay.

1.  Pre Registration Deadline, December 30th, 2008

What are you waiting for? Don't let the deadline slip you by. You would
be surprised to know how many people forget to do this. Don't let it
happen to you!

Pre-register now for only $45!

<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/registration>


2.  Furry Market Place

The surf is still up for the Furry Market Place... but only a little bit
longer as only a few spaces are left. So, if you are interested in being a
vendor in the Further Confusion 2009 Furry Market Place, go over to
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/dealers/market-place> and grab
the PDF of the application form. Print it out, fill it out and send it in
to the address on the form along with US$65.00 and grab your spot before
they are all gone. There are less than a handful left! And yes, that
price INCLUDES your full membership to the convention.


3.  Dealer Room Waiting List

While the Dealer Room is still full, the holidays are traditionally the
time that we see a few cancellations here and there as people figure out
if they are really going to be able to make it out in January. So now
might be a good time to get on the waiting list. To get on the waiting
list go to <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/dealers> and download
the application form for a table. Print it out, fill it out and send it in
to the address on the form, but WITHOUT any payment. This will get you on
the waiting list.

We will select randomly from ALL applications on the waiting list when we
have cancellation. It is NOT first-come, first served on the waiting
list. And those selected will receive a table offer by E-MAIL, so make
sure that the e-mail address you include on the form is one you check
regularly. Also, you will only have 10 days (or LESS if we are in the last
couple of weeks before the con when an offer goes out) to respond back to
that e-mail.

And lastly, we will STOP accepting new people onto the Waiting List on
December 15th, 2008. Any applications received after that date will NOT
be considered if a table opens up.


4.  Hotel

Just a reminder as we start to get closer to the convention. If you are
not going to be able to join us this coming January or have ended up
sharing with another attendee, please go ahead and cancel your room
reservations as early as possible so as to free up space for others.


5.  Fursuit Badge Submission

If you have a fursuit, are pre-registered, and need a fursuit badge,
here's what to do. Before January 1st, 2009, send a picture of your fursuit
to fursuit-badges at furtherconfusion.org and include the following
information in the email:

- Your real name
- The fursuit name
- Your membership badge number

The file can be any standard picture format (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.) at
300 dpi with a usable area of 450 by 600 pixels.

The first fursuit badge is free (though a donation to the convention
would be appreciated), while subsequent badges are $5 each.

Photographs for fursuit badges will also be taken at the convention.
Please see the times that will be posted at the Registration Desk for the
hours this will be offered.

If you are not sure that you have registered, to contact Registration
at registration at furtherconfusion.org

Hay all,

Just wanted to request some prayers for speedy recovery for Tony  
Ringtail who just had surgery.  He is doing alright but healing is  
painful of course and he's out of work for a while.
Keep him in your thoughts!!

I, too, will be having surgery December 12 if all goes well. I'll be 
having total knee replacement on the left knee.

More time to make suit pieces. Let's hope I don't needle the docs and 
nurses too much with my handsewing.

I'll add him to my prayer list over here.  That, at least, is one thing 
I can do for folks back in the states.  Anyone who sees him tell him the 
Chaps sends his best.

Hope to see you all come spring.

1. Hotel Announcement

Doubletree Room Block re-opens Dec 10 at noon Pacific time.

We are pleased to announce that, with the help of all your fellow fans
doing a good job at canceling extra rooms and consolidating them as soon
as possible, we have been able to free up enough rooms to allow us to 
re-open the Doubletree Room Block. We will do so effective December 10th
at 12 noon Pacific time.

We currently have the ONLY following free space available at the
Doubletree.

Jan 21 : 31 rooms
Jan 22 : 26 rooms
Jan 23 : 14 rooms
Jan 24 : 14 rooms
Jan 25 : 12 rooms
Jan 26 : 1  rooms

We expect to possibly pick up a few more last minute cancellations prior
to December 10th and again in the latter half of December up through our Hotel
Reservation Cutoff date on January 5th, 2009. In light of that fact, we
have decided to simply leave the block open until then once we re-open on
December 10th. Rooms will be on a first-come, first-serve basis and  should
be booked only by calling the official telephone number for reservations
(+1 408-453-4000) and using the convention Code FurCon. We expect these
rooms to be ONLY Single Kings. Only one room can be booked per person.
Please do not ask for more.

Before booking a reservation, please be sure that you need it. We will
have a lot of folks chasing a relatively small number of resources. Don't
make that problem even harder. And, please do not forget, if you
previously had a room booked at The Holiday Inn or another area hotel,
please cancel that reservation as well once you have confirmed the new
reservation at the Doubletree.

We know that although a significant number of you will benefit from
releasing these rooms to the public. A even more significant number may
still not get word in time or may simply get beat out at the draw
depending on how many folks are clamoring for a space. We truly appreciate
your forbearance and kindness in dealing with the Hotel Reservations and
other staff and we truly hope to reduce this issue in the future.


2. Looking for more Staff

Yes, we still need staff members to round out some departments. We
especially are looking for people for our Convention Operations (Con Ops)
to cover some shifts there. If you are a night owl (or
lupine/canine/feline/reptile) willing to cover Con Ops between the hours
of 2am to 6am, at any time or throughout the con, please contact us! Con
Ops is the central point of contact for the convention, so if you ever
wanted to know what goes on at a con, you'll find out by working Con Ops.

Please contact us at HR at furtherconfusion.org if you can help.


3. Art Show

The Art Show is almost sold out, but we still have some limited space
available. Act now, before all the spaces are gone! 

For more details, see the Art Show page at
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/artshow>


4. Furry Market Place

We're full up, folks! Thank you all for the excellent response.  All 20
spaces are now full. However, it is always possible that there  will be a
cancellation before the convention, so if you are still interested and
don't mind not knowing for sure if you will have space or not until
possibly the last minute, look to the section below in this newsletter
for how to get on the waiting list.


5. Dealer Room and Furry Market Place Waiting List

With both the Dealer Room and the Furry Market Place full, getting space
to sell at the convention is going to be a little difficult.  Our first
recommendation is that you check the list of dealers in the Dealer Room
and Furry Market Place on the website and contact your friends if you see
them there and contact them to see if they can carry your wares in return
for you helping them man their table during the convention.

Second, you can send in a Waiting List Application and get added
to the Random Lottery for a space if someone cancels from one of
the two selling areas. To get on the list, go to
<http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/dealers> and download the Waiting
List Application you will find there. Fill it out and get it to us before
December 15th, 2008 and your name will be placed into the lottery for any
space that opens up.

Please be aware, there are a fair number of people on the Waiting List
already. But selection from the list is in a Random Lottery
so that everyone on the Waiting List has an equal chance to be selected.


6. Live! Action! Drawing!

Live! Action! Drawing! is a newish event that happens during the  
night dances, and we're looking for some more artists to participate.

Each night up on stage during the dance, we'll have an easel set up  under
a spotlight.  Artists will be scheduled and have roughly 60 to 90 minutes
to draw.  The artist is encouraged to draw from inspiration in the room,
the lights, the music, the dancers.  We provide the paper and the
implementations, we  just need a few more artists to participate.

If you're interested, send an email to dances at furtherconfusion.org


7. Announcing Furry Night Live 2009!

Hey Dudes and Dudettes, grab your boards and head to the stage!  Further
Confusion's Surf Safari keeps rolling with our Sunday evening tradition -
Furry Night Live! FNL09 is currently accepting not only live on-stage acts
but video submissions as well, competing for audience  votes and prizes.

Awesome acts are not built overnight! Need help getting your act ready?
got questions on equipment or regulations? Looking for a few extra surf
dawgs to round out your beach party? Join the FNL09 Discussion Mailing
List: <http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/signup/fnl>
(FNL'08 membership does not carry over to 2009)

Space is limited for acts, so don't get left with your head in the sand!
Also check out <http://furrynightlive.livejournal.com> for future
announcements and discussion. If you have any questions, please contact
fnl-staff at furtherconfusion.org


8. Furcon Twitter Feed

Further Confusion is now on Twitter! You can find us at
<http://twitter.com/furcon>

We will be using this feed to send out announcement as the convention
approaches, and during the con we'll be sending out reminders for upcoming
major events - eg, registration opening, masquerade starting, and so on,
not to mention any last minute programming changes.


9. Next Staff Meeting

Our next staff meeting will be on December 13th, starting at 1pm in the
San Jose DoubleTree hotel. Parking is free - we will be providing stickers
at the meeting which will allow the parking staff to know you were with
Further Confusion, and let you out without needing to pay.

Subject: FL: Furry Weekend Atlanta: Call for Panelists
Message-ID: <120320081636.21449.4936B5A20001C0A8000053C922165486869801000E9B020E9C@comcast.net>

With less than four months to go before Furry Weekend Atlanta 2009
(March 19-22), its time for me to start solidifying the Fursuiting and 
Pawpetry Track.  While I'll be contacting certain individuals directly in 
the near future, I want to put out an open call for panelists for the track. 
I'm looking for panelists who would like to present on the following 
topics, and would like to have two to three panelists for each topic:

* Introduction to Fursuiting 
* Fursuit Performance 101 
* Fursuit Construction 101 
* Pawpet Performance 101 
* Pawpet Construction 101

Also, if you have an interest in presenting on a specialty or advanced topic 
in Fursuiting or Pawpetry, just let me know - I'd really like to offer a variety 
of specialty topics, but that depends on having willing panelists.  Even if
you're not sure your idea is panel-worthy, send it to me anyway, as I might
be able to help you shape it into something that could work out quite nicely.

On the Pawpetry side, I'm looking for pawpeteers who would want to work
with me on some short (think three to five minute) planned performances.
You don't have to be an expert puppeteer by any means, but having at
least a little experience would be very helpful.

Finally, I'm looking for a Pawpet Track Second-in-Command, who would 
help me coordinate Pawpetry panels, shows, and activities, primarily 
during the convention, but also before the con to some extent. This would 
be a staff position and would come with all of the duties and perks of any
first-time FWA staff position.

If you are interested in being a panelist, puppet performer, or helping out 
with the pawpetry track, please let me know ASAP.

Thanks,
Santa Fox 
FWA Fursuiting and Pawpetry Track Director

Subject: FL: FC2009: Concerning the Doubletree room block
Message-ID: <20081209042810.GA66012@critter.net>

In our last newsletter we announced that we would be re-opening our
block with the Doubletree for reservations on December 10th. It was our
plan to do this because the Doubletree had informed us that there was
space within our block to do so. Unfortunately, they have since told us
that their prior statement was incorrect and that the availability they
believed was there was only due to some - at the time - incomplete work
with transferring over to a different reservations system.

We understand that this reversal of our previous announcement may be
upsetting for those of you that were hopeful of the chance to get a room
in the Doubletree. At the time of our announcement, we had been assured
by the hotel that the numbers were correct, and were very surprised to
now find out that this was not the case. Of course, this means that our
reservation block will -not- be re-opening on December 10th now.

If you still are looking for accommodation for Further Confusion, we
have recently heard from the Courtyard San Jose Airport (located at 1727
Technology Drive - about 3/4 mile from the Doubletree, or a 15 minute
walk) that they have rooms available. Please note that Further Confusion
does -not- have a contract with this hotel as an official overflow, and
-cannot- guarantee a special convention rate -or- provide shuttle
service. The phone number for the Courtyard San Jose Airport is
1-408-441-6111.

4.  Hotel News


Currently the room blocks are sold out at both the DoubleTree and Holiday
Inn. There may be a few minute last cancellations and you should check
directly with the hotel for the possibility.

5.  Dealers Room and Furry Market Place: Sold Out, Waiting List Closed

We have a wonderful collection of dealers in both the Dealer Room and
Furry Market Place looking forward to showing their wares and offering
them for sale during our upcoming Surf Safari. We also just closed our
application process for our Waiting List. It's just getting very, very
close to the convention and we wish all of you and yours a merry holiday
from all of us in the Dealer Room area.

Those of you on the Waiting List know who you are, be sure to check your
email on a regular basis as we will be contacting one or more of you the
moment space should happen to become available.

For those of you that are IN our Dealer Room or Furry Market Place, if,
for some unforeseen reason find yourself unable to make it to the
convention, please, please, please let the dealer room staff know as soon
as you know by writing to dealers at furtherconfusion.org. That way we can
get you refunded and let one of those people waiting on the Waiting List
into the room in time for them to get their wares together. We don't want
to lose ANY of you from our vendor areas, but we always will understand
when circumstances change and you can't make it. No Shows do NOT get any
refunds, so if you can't make it, let us know!


6.  Art Show

By the time this email goes out, our Art show will be sold out. We hope to have
a list of participating artist up on our website soon. If you are
uncertain about your art show status, please email
artshow at furtherconfusion.org


7.  Masquerade

It's time to get thinking about entries for this year's Masquerade!
Maybe just a bit past time, but here it goes...

The Masquerade rules have been posted to the Further Confusion web site
shortly. It is highly recommend that everyone read the rules for this
year, as we've made several important changes. Also, Saturday is a long
day for costumers, packed with many fursuit-related events, so if you're
going to be in the Masquerade and/or FNL, please check the convention
schedule carefully for how it applies to you.

The Masquerade will have a 'strongly recommended' judging session from
1:00am to 11:00am on Saturday morning, and a MANDATORY rehearsal and further
judging from 5:00pm to 7:00pm Saturday evening. We'd like to take care of as
many entrants as possible in the morning hour, so please come to the
earlier session if it's practical.

Masquerade entry forms will be available at the morning judging session
and from 11:00am in the Events Office. Entry forms MUST be turned in by 4:00pm
Saturday! Also, please have your audio CD ready (as described in the
rules) by 4:00pm, or we'll have to choose a musical selection for you, and
just might pick Hamsterdance to get you back!

Masquerade Rules are online at:
http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2009/events/masquerade

Is there any fur that's is planing on going from the SF bay area that
might have car and crash space? I am willing to sleep on the floor of
a hotel.

Rapid T. Rabbit here Forwarding this open invitation:

"Hi... A new club for people who wear mascot uniforms is beginning in
New York City.  It's called Club Animals.  It was started by two
artists and novice mascot wearers.  We liked the idea of wearing
mascot costumes in public and would like to invite others interested
into our club.  We're most interested in the spectacle of wearing
costumes in public together and doing things, such as going to dinner
or going to bars.  Our meetings will be social events with a dash of
performance art.  Our meetings also will offer discussions of mascot
topics (such as past mascot clubs or performers who had an art slant)
as well as guest speakers.  The first meeting is January 17th, 2009.
If you're interested please contact Nate at goodapplepie at gmail.com or
see our website at: http://clubanimalsnyc.blogspot.com/ "

REMEMBER THIS  AT CHRISTMAS TIME 

According to  the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, while both male and 
female reindeer grow  antlers in the summer each year, male reindeer drop their 
antlers at the  beginning of winter, usually late November to mid-December. 
Female reindeer  retain their antlers till after they give birth in the spring. 
Therefore,  according to EVERY historical rendition depicting Santa's reindeer, 
EVERY single  one of them, from Rudolph to Blitzen, had to be a girl. We 
should've known...  ONLY women would be able to drag a fat-ass man in a red velvet 
suit all around  the world in one night and not get lost.

REMEMBER THIS

According to 
the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, while both male and female reindeer grow 
antlers in the summer each year, male reindeer drop their antlers at the 
beginning of winter, usually late November to mid-December. Female reindeer 
retain their antlers till after they give birth in the spring. Therefore, 
according to EVERY historical rendition depicting Santa's reindeer, EVERY single 
one of them, from Rudolph to Blitzen, had to be a girl. We should've known... 
ONLY women would be able to drag a fat-ass man in a red velvet suit all around 
the world in one night and not get lost.

No, no, no. You have it all wrong. The males are smart enough to not be
around when its time to pull the fat guy and his heavy sleigh. As for the
part about the female reindeer not getting lost, the fay guy is doing the
driving. If you left it to the female deer, they would be stopping at every
gas station asking for directions.

Subject: FL: Doubletree room at FC
Message-ID: <COL101-W545347254BB13C06451A83A5EB0@phx.gbl>


Merry Christmas Furs!Me and a furmate are looking for 1 or 2 roomies for FC. There is a slight chance she won't be going due to medical reasons, so there 'may' be a chance for a third. Hopefully we'll know within 2 weeks of the con. As of now, we could use 1 more for sure and if everyone is ok with the 'sardine effect', we're willing to squeeze in a second. If we get four furs, the cost will be $30 per person per night.....can't beat that unless you're willing to sleep in your vehicle. I will keep this list informed of any changes.Also, I have a rez at the holiday inn that I will be keeping up until a week before the con. If anyone can use this, let me know. Jo'

Message-ID: <COL101-W196D6D304BA22485846769A5E40@phx.gbl>


Hello fellow furs:Firstly, I would like to draw your attention to our new fur site, www.albertafurries.ca Secondly, some of you may be aware of our yearly outdoor exhibition known as the Calgary Stampede. I am conducting a poll to find out how many furs will be attending the stampede in 2009 and how many of you would be interested in participating in any furry events while visiting our city. The stampede takes place in July, so we have plenty of time to get things organized, but we need to get an idea of how many people we are dealing with. Thank you.*snugs*.....Jo'

against artist. Come down, get picked and take the challenge. Plus you, the
audience, can decide what happens!


6.  Live Action Drawing

Live! Action! Drawing! is a newish event that happens during the night dances,
and we're looking for some more artists to participate.

Each night up on stage during the dance, we'll have an easel set up under a
spotlight. Artists will be scheduled and have roughly 60 to 90 minutes to
draw. The artist is encouraged to draw from inspiration in the room, the
lights, the music, the dancers. We provide the paper and the implementations,
we just need a few more artists to participate.

If you're interested, send an email to dances at furtherconfusion.org


7.  Shave Ice at the Hotel!

In addition to the normal food cart stands at the hotel this year.
We are pleased to bring you a Hawaii classic "shave ice". This treat
will be on sale during the con in a variety of syrups for $3.00
Keep an eye out for other food and beverage specials throughout the
hotel as they join in on the "Surf Safari" theme.


8.  Laptop Warning!

Please remember that Hotel Wireless Access Points are often prime territory
for Security Issues. If you are traveling with a laptop or PC, please be sure
to turn off all shares and minimize security risks to protect yourself and
your property.

Furthermore, if traveling internationally with a laptop of other electronic
mass storage device, please be aware that Customs and Homeland Security may

locked down by now. This can be found online at:

11. Open call for open mic event

This is a new event that will be happening at FC this year. The idea is to
create an open format type event where musicians can come together to create
music. If you are a musician, bring an instrument with you to FC this year if
you'd like to participate. The event will happen on Saturday night starting at
11:00pm in the double city room of the Double Tree. Bring your music (vocalists
are also welcome) to participate. Bring your ears if you just want to sit in
the audience and listen to the magic.

To keep some order to the Chaos, we've set up a quick set of guidelines
for the participants:  The moderator will give approval before a new
person joins the jam; the moderator can kick people off or have them
take a break; if someone is waiting to join the jam, keep it to 5
minutes (or so); don't get too loud; be respectful of others.
