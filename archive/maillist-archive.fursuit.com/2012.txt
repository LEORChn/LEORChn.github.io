I need to talk to somebody who has brought a pair of these. In essence I
need the measurement of the foot length from the heel to the footplate.

Many thanks

I'm fairly confident the Weta Legs were never released to the public.  
Something about not having enough interest to make it worth their while.

approached) by another manufacturer.

There's a lot of info on the stilts here:

Hi Folks
Yes Yesengrin - I know about the Digilegs from Area51.

I've chatted with Kim several times on the difficult journey she has had to
get the stilts marketed from Weta's original enthusiasm and then their
decision not to market.

My own suspisions are that Weta wanted the stilts to use in the Narnia
movies and needed Kim's designs.

I could ask Kim however from previous conversations with her she has
indicated NDA's with Area51 so I will not press her

Many thanks
Marc

Just for people's interest - here are my stilts in progress.
http://www.marcwolf.org/gallery/default.aspx?aid=5

I have completed them (still need to put up the rest of the pictures)

I took them down to MidFur 13 last week and wore them around, plus a lot of
other folks wanted to try them on.
When watching people run around in them it seemed that the angle between the
foot-length and the ground was more akin to 30 degrees' rather than the 45
degree's that I have seen in some others.

A 60 degree stance seems more appropriate to me..    At the moment the
length of my foot section is not adjustable but it will be in a few days,
also the actual footplate will be able to have several preset angles (45,
52.5, 60) degrees for adjustments.

When I get the right one I will be putting on a larger paw type section with
toes that can drop and raise to give a better look when walking.

I applaud your metal working skills Dave. One thing I was wondering
though, is how much to these things weigh? It seems both your set and
Area51's are made from mild steel. I'm going to make a wild guess at 11
pounds apiece. Has there been any thought about moving to TIG and doing
them in 6061 aluminum? It's machinable , weldable, and quite strong. It'll
also cut the weight by about 40%.

Thanks for you kind comments Dan
I had a lot of fun making them - my first experiment in using a MIG welder.

I believe it is possible to convert my MIG to a TIG by changing the output
polarity but that is something I will have to experiment with.

I'll have to get back to you re the weight as I am working on them at the
moment

>From what I have calculated from various articles

1. The stilts raise the wearer up 12 to 14"
2. The angle of the footplate to the footlength is 45 degrees
3. The knee needs to be placed approx over the footplate for balace

In these I found that my footlength is currently 15" and needs to be about
19", so I am adding a slidable extension to them.

Anyway - I'll keep the maillist posted on the outcome

Marc

I am wondering how far this is going. Will we be seeing in a couple of
years commonly fursuits that look as if they are truly humanoid
animals and quad suits that are almost unidentifiable as fursuit but
are mistaken for real animals? Even the toonish suits are sliding
towards being more realistic than really truly tooish.

Back when I went to my first furcons Rotty my rottweiler fursuit was
praised for being such a realistic fursuit and by today's standards it
would be called a toonish suit.

Today's fandom has forgotten its roots for the most part... as far as
art and fursuiting is concerned.
Fursuits have become the latest fashions, not a character you bring to
life.  The mention of "mascots",  "performance", and "getting into
character" causes snickering and comments like "You're way to into
this" .

Times have changed, and sometimes I wonder what fandom I'm actually
in.  I'm gonna remain oldschool, though.  B3

I don't even have a costume yet, but if I do, one thing I'll personally
try to do is draw a clear distinction between the art of fursuiting and
what are now stereotypical furry activities. I'm in agreement about trying
to use the costume as a way of creating a character; essentially becoming
an actor within the fursuit.

In terms of realism versus toony, I don't see it as a bad thing: More like
a broadening of the spectrum of the art. My costume (which has not been
delivered yet) is more realistic in nature but has slightly larger eyes
than real life in order to enhance the illusion.

My goals are not to necessarily attend furmeets or cons, but to use it in
the local public arena, At fairs, parades, special events, etc. Since I've
never done anything like this, never met anyone who does this, and never
even seen anyone do this before in my community, it's really an
undiscovered country with huge, unknown challenges, pitfalls, and rewards.
 However I will make sure that anyone I meet or interact with knows that a
fursuit (which I intentionally call 'costume') does not necessarily mean
CSI furry.  Sort of like the difference between a gun owner versus an
armed bank robber. It's not the tool that makes the person, but how you
use it.

In terms of direction - Do you really see the realism of the fursuit as a
strong trend? ...and which of the commercial costume creators do you see
as the principal drivers of this trend?

Wow wee! Actual chatter from a mailing list. I'd forgotten what genuine 
chatter was on these lists.

I think it was 10 years ago, there was all sorts of excitement over a 
real bear suit and a real (abiet GIANT) dog suit. The more real a 
fursuit gets, I say let it rock. If you want to wear it at a con, so be 
it. Be the non anthro version of the animal at a con? So be it. I only 
wish I could get that close.

The difference is a personal choice. A lot goes into performing. Say 
what you will about getting into character, when you put on a costume, 
you're not exactly who you were.  You've "transformed" your look at 
least, and people are going to see you different.

If a quad Old English Sheepdog suit came my way, and it was real 
looking/seeming down to the ears flopping, eyes moving, tounge panting, 
I'd play the part with no problem. I wouldn't be talky, popped head at 
the bar having a beer.

I have always wanted to be close to what I am. My Ric O Classic was one 
of the first with a moveable mouth so I could bark. You can't look back, 
but you can't be embarrased you're not wearing the latest thing.

True humanoid animal fursuits are the next best thing and let you enjoy 
a little more of the silly because the human side of you can perform as 
well. I wouldn't be seen with a guitar as a OES, but as an OES Anthro, 
I'd be working with claws and paws to strum away.

This fursuit thing to me has always been about being closer to who I am. 
If you want to have Jay Leno's garage, only fursuits, so be it.

Wait, what? Since when did the art of performance get lost in fursuits? I've not once heard snickers or jabs about being 'too into this' when I play my character. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the entire point of fursuiting? I don't know about you guys, but I get annoyed as hell when I see someone just standing around in fursuit. Contrary to popular belief, not EVERYONE can be a fursuiter, just as not everyone can be a truly wonderful artist. You have to have a passion for acting and entertaining cause that's exactly what fursuiting is. If you are going to just put on a fursuit, stand there, and look pretty, you might as well save your money and buy something else cause in my opinion, it's a waste of fur and space. Just my two cents.

Vitai,

You and I are two peas in a pod, kitty.  But I swear I've heard it
with my own ears.  I made a comment about people standing around
wearing expensive rugs, and was met with the kinds of comments I
mentioned.  On multiple occasions.  I've also heard furries complain
about "performing" for curious onlookers while we were on an outing in
public.  "This is MY suit.  I'm not wearing it for them.  They should
mind their own business" etc.

I'm telling you, times are changing.  And attitudes like this is why
people's minds wander about what we're doing in these costumes.

But seriously, I 100% agree with all of your opinions.

M'yow,

My 2nd suit, which is still being built, has been designed by me to look 
halfway between toony and realistic. It's very manga inspired, with the idea 
for it to look truely anthro, rather than an animal standing up.

Regarding the performance part, as a trained actor and dancer, I know all 
about how to look and move when in costume. I don't like going to cons 
without a suit, since I feel I can't get fully into the spirit of the 
convention without the full experience. I've been criticised for this 
myself, having been told "You don't need a suit to enjoy the con." Well for 
me, I do. I love being in the FVS (Or FNL as it's called), and I adore all 
the dances, and never go to them unsuited.

I love the humanoid furry look. It's my specialty actually, something 
that looks like a blend of human and animal, short muzzles and even 
proportions. Everyone has their preferences and there is no reason why 
difference in style should be viewed as destructive to a group that is 
supposedly about self expression.

Change is to be expected, especially as the fandom grows but the truly 
vibrant performers will always stand out and be the focal point of 
events. A boring person in an animal costume is still boring. ^^

I am a little conflicted. On one side, I do hate that fursuits just seem
to be 'how much money can I spend to make some nice eye candy?' 
But
on the other hand, I hate the idea that I always have to be
"performing" when I am in suit. I like just "standing
around" while in suit, hanging out with friends. Why? Because my suit
is like me, it is just a furrier extension of my own personality, So if I
want to stand around and hang with my friends, it could be in, or out of
my suit. 
I am not wearing my suit for other people, I am wearing it
for myself, and no one else. So I am not going to perform for others, I an
going to do what I want to in it.

To be honest:  I don't really care what direction the art is going.  Just
the fact that there are so many different suits out now is a wonderful
thing.

Art is always subjective on an individual bases.  So really, there is no
right or wrong.

Well, for a long time i have thought that fursuits in general had bigger heads than they actually are. Without using the excuse that the character is supposed to be huminoid is is it possible that the fandom has delibrately used this really slim body and way to small head to make up for the lack of body pods etc...

I would dearly like your thoughts on why is a smaller mascot hybrid not classified as a true fursuit:-)

I still see more toony suits than realistic suits at cons. But if there 
was a trend moving toward realistic suits, so what?

I also fail to see how someone can make the connection between "more 
realistic fursuits" and "sex". A realistic fursuit is no more of a sex 
toy than a toony one.

You can voice your concerns about public perception or misrepresentation 
of the fandom, but blaming it on a random trend (if it even exists) 
comes off as radical "think of the children" paranoia.

I agree with the idea that the role of fursuits has changed (or 
diversified), but not the implication that it's a bad thing. Just as people 
have different motivations for being in the fandom, they have different 
motivations for wearing a fursuit. seaweed's post is an excellent example of 
this.

Whether we reserve "fursuiter" for those who intend to perform is 
debatable - after all, what if you have therianthropic tendencies? You may 
be "trying to get into character", but not for anyone else's benefit.

Either way, the change is not likely to stop. Research suggests that around 
45% of furries and almost 60% of therians want
to own a fursuit - not including the ~13% who already do:
http://www.flayrah.com/3841/mixed-venue-survey-delineates-furries-therians-otherkin

I strongly doubt that the sole motivation of these people is to perform;
it may also not be their primary motivation.

For therians, there is an obvious goal - becoming closer to the physical 
form of the animal which they feel spiritually connected to. For furries, a 
fursuit is a form of identity, like con badge visible from fifty paces. It 
can be a way of interacting with people who would otherwise treat you 
differently because of your sex or race. And of course it can be used as a 
pure fashion accessory; a form of conspicuous consumption.

Around 70% of furries own accessories such as ears or tails, and I suspect
that if the price of a full fursuit dropped to the level of an accessory,
we'd see at least 60% of furs owning one - though given baggage fees, they
might not all get brought to conventions.

Well, in fairness, you were kinda insulting them. ;-)

More to the point, a fursuit can still be appreciated by others as artwork. 
Tapestries are just expensive rugs, yet we value them. As a photographer, I 
prefer to take action shots, but even a static shot can be nice to have as 
long as it's of something pretty.

I'd say fursuits nowadays tend to be more *detailed* than those we've seen 
in the past. There are plenty of possible reasons for this - a desire for 
individuality and a close representation of a character, the growing ability 
of fursuit makers to meet the challenges of realistic fursuits, the fact 
that fursuits are almost always seen at close range, unlike (say) mascots, . 
. .

Cartoons are cartoony because they have to be quick to draw and easy to see 
on a fuzzy screen. Costumes of cartoons need to match the characters. 
However, furry characters span the range of tooniness, so we should expect 
fursuits to match that.

I think there's a far clearer link between "people who use fursuits as part 
of their identity" and "sex". Indeed, the one person I know who does have 
sex in their fursuit explained that they wanted to feel themselves while 
doing it (they were a lifestyler who also spent a lot of time in suit around 
the house, at restaurants, etc.).

The only reason tooniness might matter is if toonier suits are more often 
used for performance rather than identity - which might be the case, but 
probably isn't a strong factor.

Now, obviously I didn't say it to anyone's face, or about any certain
person in particular.  Just like how this whole discussion didn't name
any names.  It was basically a verbal version of this email
discussion, except it took place 2 years ago.  I was talking to
non-suited fursuiters and random other furries.

Boosh, there it is.  Well played Laurence.

A little addition to the sexual part of the discussion:

A major part (if not the only part) to being a member of living organisims
is reproduction.  It's natural, and a lot of the time "good".  Being human
is the biggest kinky deviance of all time.  Fursuits really don't do any
thing out of the ordinary, even if they are being ordained for sexual
fantasy.

What I'm saying is that, as furries, as homosapians, as biology, we should
all be more accepting of individual sexuality (within legal limits and
reason, of course), and not pretend it never happens.  I've found that
denying out right increases suspition of further deviance.  But
acknowledging it happens not more or less often than normal, people shrug
shoulders, and go about their buisiness.

So yeah.  Being a fur / fursuiter shouldn't force anoyone to be a prude or
into uncomfortable situations.

Ok, enough fuzzy-wisdom...I need sleep!

Sup, FuzzyRoo!  Long time, no type!

My official stance on murrsuits is this..
I don't care if people bonk in their rugs.  That's their business, and
adults have been playing naughty dress-up since the fig leaf. You're
right, though.. acting like there's no WAY it happens makes it look
like we're hiding something.

What DOES irk me, though, is when obvious yiff-suits are walking
around interacting with the general public.

Also.. idk how we got to this part of this.. but yeah.

Yo and hi :3

You get a problem, though.  Some furs have inter-changable parts, like
multiple copies of the same body.   That, and good fursuit cleaning and
general hyginie should be top priority regardless of use.

Physically, if you wear a suit through public transportation, it winds up
just as dirty, if not more, than anything to can do with a 20/20 report
black light, lol.   But seriously:  for all uses, wolight wash, anti bacta
spray, body scent spray + deoderant.

Personnally I think the realistic suit = made for sex connection to be fallacious.

A lot of 'adult' suit and 'modified' plushy are toonis in nature. (Not that I own or use either, but I know people who do, to each his own)

I shared the common sentiment of this list the more suits the better, partial ; full etc...

Toony or not I welcome the increase in suiters

As a therio myself I have fitted in with the furry scene very well. 
However to me my suit is a way to bring my wolven side into this world.  As
such I have made him to be as realistic as possible (and continue to do so
with animatronics etc). 

When I wear him I can be comic if I want to.. but other times I just want to
relax in a form that to myself - is the real me. Interacting with people as
an intelligent being and not some childish characture

As for genitaila and it's functionability - yes I would like to have that on
my suit but only for the completeness of the illusion. I am lupine and so I
feel that the form of my male parts be simular in construction.  Wether I
use them for purely eliminatory purposes or further is entirely up to me.
Not that I would got out of my way to alienate myself to the public  But if
someone was standing next to me when I was at a rest stop then if they
looked what I hope they would see would just increase the realism.

I suppose another way to look at it is this.
If a spaceship landed and the occupants were  anthrowolf in shape and
civilised - how would they react in public. As civilised beings having
dignity.. or comic clowns.

Just my viewpoint
Marc

I agree with you totally,

While I am not sure I an therian, Owl for me is a totem and spirit companion and guide and has been so for roughly 30 years...

As such I too want my owl suit to be as realistic as possible ; I however have other toonier suit I wear and have fun in it too....

But then for me ; it is the owl in me that disguise him/itself :))

I'm planning and hoping to put together a fursuit bowling event in my 
area.  The problem I am running into is how to go about contacting 
bowling centers without sounding sketchy and up to no good.  Anyone have 
suggestions so we don't surprise/upset anyone or make trouble?

Keep in mind, the area I live in has scarcely even heard of furries.

Hey Andrew I'd be very interested in going and Bizbone on FA may be able to help you contact a bowling alley. :) he's set up a bowling meet before! I would also like to know what area will this be in? Since I'm in the coral gables area of Miami. :) thank you!

call them up, and tell them what you want to do. here is how I've approached it?

"A group of mascots are out having a get together for fun.  they are not for any particular company, but freelance performers who do things for private parties and charities, and they get together every once in a while to have retriets and some fun."

Things you need to ask the alley:

Are they ok with the mascots using their own feet.  Many lanes have strict policies that may not allow it.  bring a fursuit foot to the lane in question and show it to them, to show that it's a slick surface  (generally carpet bottom paws are good for this..  do not show them a paw with a rubber sole)

Find out what the group rate is..  try to get a flat rate per hour rather then per frame..  Suiters are chaotic in bowling, and skipping/changing lineup/etc makes it hard to keep frames bowled straight

Do they have a party room of some sorts, that has a private from public view, to be used as a headless lounge?

Will they supply water for the suiters?

Another thing that ticks off the lanes is when you have 10 suiters show up to play, and 30 people out of suit that don't pay to bowl, but want to just watch..   This is bad tact, and won't make friends with the lane management.  you might want to make a policy of if people are going..  even if they don't want to bowl, pay into whatever the group rate is.

and another thing that seems to be the biggest faux paux of most bowling events, and has gotten groups kicked out and banned from bowling events?
and I am not trying to start a flame with this, but I have seen it happen a couple times already..

Bowling tends to be a family, and "redneck" type event.  They do not take kindly to alternative life styles. Do not gay pride the event, dry hump, grope, kiss face, etc, etc at the lanes..  parents with kids and right wing league players may complain to the manegement, and you will get banned.  You should treat this as if you are performing in an elementary school..  all eyes are on you in fursuit, and you need to keep your actions to G rating.  If you don't look "wholesome" to the lanes, where they are not afraid of you interacting with the kids in the lanes, you will be fine..  but you won't get very far when they fear letting kids go visit the two dogs that were "humping" on the lane.

Thanks, Yappyfox

My friends have had events at skateland, and we had to do the same kind of
thing. But, the trick is, if there are gropes, dont make them a big deal.
Sure we got the occasional raised eyebrow, but its like being at school,
try to act normal when texting in class. Being one without a suit brought
attention when I was kissed or groped, but I acted normal and just laughed
it out.

Best Regards,
Blinx the Golden Retriever

Some alleys might not mind watchers if it means more sales at the bar and concession area. That might be another good thing to ask them.

You could always use their ignorance as a chance to set the tone to
super-positive from the start, since they're a blank slate.
Furry bowling events are getting more popular - there were those articles
about the klingon-furry matchup a while back, and the local events in
Seattle have made the newspaper twice - Once back in like 2008 (Kent) and
more recently at the very wonderfully helpful Kenmore lanes and with the
help of my friend Kijani Lion.

http://www.meetup.com/furlife/events/46662392/ The way I look at it ...
your alley has a chance start something great.

If you're worried, that's what'll make you seem sketchy. Make this seem
like the best idea in the world, because maybe it is :)

Turn their ignorance into something that will benefit you and them. 
Yappy's suggestions are quite good and they work. I've set up a couple 
bowling in fursuit events and they went well. I told them we had some 
mascot costumers bowling while in costume, and we'd like to have maybe 4 
lanes. I asked if they had a changing room or a place to change that's not 
the restroom. I made no mention of furry.

Then let the event happen. Sure, you're bound to get some kids watching, 
which is a bonus. Even more so if there's a birthday event or kid's 
bowling league. You're bound to get some people watching, but there's 
always going to be someone watching others bowl, but it's not reasonable 
to have a big crowd as Yappy said.

If the alley people want to know more about the costumes/suits, bring 
along yours and your friend with his suit, and let the manager see what to 
expect. Don't give them an excuse to turn you down too quickly.

Interestingly,

I've never seen a fursuit in real life here in Mid-Michigan and no one
that I know has seen one before. However they will get to see one the week
of April 1st, when mine gets delivered. I have been showing people the
following picture of Tycho, which has been created by Beastcub, and with
only one or two exceptions, everyone is fascinated and wants to see it in
real life. In fact, the costume's debut will be here at my place of work
where half the company is waiting to see it. There are no prejudices
against fursuits at this point in time and I want to ensure it stays that
way.

Fursuit bowling sounds fun, however if I ever even thought that there
might be the possibility of witnessing groping / being groped in any way
other than Disney / family-friendly ways, I would most likely not attend.
It's not my culture. That kind of behavior is not conducive for setting
good impressions for the general public, especially in a place where you
find kids and older people. I want to enjoy my fursuit costume in as many
venues as possible when it arrives, and *do not* want to have to fight
against a stereotype.

So, if you bring your artwork to the bowling center, are genuinely
enthusiastic about it, you are right - you might be able to really get a
super-positive start! Who knows - They might even be able to turn it into
a marketing opportunity, especially if you can do a mini-performance for
the rest of public that happens to use the bowling center. Keep me
informed how it goes, since I'm also starting from scratch.

p.s. The preview of Tycho is now available via Lilleah West's gallery at
Beastcub.

You might want to check out what really happens at the Disney parks
with the costumed characters before you make such claims. There is a
reason that. "Hi ho hi ho its off to court we go" is one of the top
ten songs at Disney.

Man, I wish I had a fur suit like you guys, but I don't. (Feels sad).
I really wish you or anybody else that is on the site could make me
one someday.  I really want one though.

I didn't know the first thing about making fursuits when I made my first one. $100 for supplies and I taught myself how to sew.

I would suggest that the first fursuit that you make you use the
cheapest material that you can find and when your done throw it out.
You will make lots of mistakes and if you will be throwing the test
suit out anyways you wont get discouraged.

Good luck

I'm not really making a claim; more like a perception. I want to
participate in an environment that fits the perceived 'Disney' standard of
behavior as recognized by the general public. Whether or not that standard
is broken by some individuals within the employ of Disney does not by
itself change the standard. Misbehavior can be found anywhere you go.

Misbehavior means behavior that is not in keeping with the culture of your
current environment. I like to have fun and push the envelope once and a
while, but I don't necessarily feel the need to misbehave. Different
environments give us the chance to behave in different ways without
misbehaving. I love to hit 145 MPH at the top-end of the track at Memphis
Motorsports park (or Gingerman raceway in Michigan) when racing my Trans
Am, but I stick to no more than five MPH over the speed limit when
cruising the freeway. I happily follow the traffic guidelines to set a
positive example. Same deal; find an environment where the behavior is
acceptable.

In this case, interacting within a non-furry public at a bowling alley,
the best thing to do is conform to the mainstream culture in terms of
behavior but do it in a whimsical way that encourages positive feelings
without making the other guests uncomfortable. No dry humping, no groping,
and no throwing bowling balls down the aisle to knock down little kids. No
matter how much fun it might seem like at the time... It makes the
parents, management, and patrons uncomfortable. Save it for a furrycon
where knocking down then glomping a fellow fursuiter is accepted as
standard behavior..

..though maybe I'm simply reading too seriously into your joke ;)

Not addressing this to anyone in particular, but someone ought to mention
the etiquette of not hijacking a thread with another topic. Fursuit Building
doesn't have much to do with Organizing Public Fursuit Events. Please change
the subject of the new topic so it's not confused with the original topic.

Thanks.

Aww, don't feel bad.  I don't have a fursuit either, but I have multiple 
friends who do that I'm acting as front man/public relations for.  I'm 
saving up for a fursuit though!

I started saving on December of 2009 but couldn't convince the wife that
"we" should save 'our' money for such a thing. So I parted out a '72 Honda
SL350 motorcycle that I got for free, sold my 25th anniversary Crafter ML
Rose acoustic guitar, sold my PLC controlled ceramics kiln, and both sets
of race tires to finance the project.

Two years later.... at the end of this month, it'll finally get delivered.
Sometimes it takes a while, Zach.  Fifty bucks at a time and you'll get
there.

Oh, and I just got word from city council from the neighboring city that
they'd be happy to have me in their Jubilee parade in costume in late
June. "The crazier the better", the parade organizer said. She said that
they wanted it to be less centered on vintage tractors.

Let's hope for partly cloudy and mid-70's :)

Sad that you had to sell all of that stuff but it must save a lot of 
space for the suit!  I've been saving money from paychecks since June to 
fund my fursuit endeavors.  Makes it easier that my mate and I keep our 
finances separate, that way we can manage things our own way and still 
pay all the bills :)

One saving method I've found works is taking a small percentage out of 
my pay immediately while still leaving enough for bills, groceries, and 
other neccesary expenses.  Now obviously this method doesn't work for 
everyone but it's still a good concept.

You should totally keep an eye out for fur sales and stuff.  Even at
places like Wal-Mart after Halloween.  Hoard the stuff until you find
a use for it!

This suit cost me $35 total to make:

most banks and credit unions have auto trasfur now. you can iopen a savgings or xmoss type of account and have the bank move a few dollars a week to the saving account to fund your suit. Also pick up a large jar and toss your extra change into it. a years worth of spare change can add up quickly. one other trick is holiday temp job. places like walmart if there open 24 hours for the xmas season need stockers and or unloaders or people to put bikes together.

It is a hoax. Thingsjust don't quite add up.

For example, why is he flapping the wings? Birds open up there wing
tip feathers so air can pass through them on the up beat and close
them on the down beat to trap the air under the wing to give lift. I
don't see anything on the wings that would let air pass through the
wings on the up beat. The frame would be a lot more durable with out
the motion of beating wings. So why is he flapping the wings?

If it was not for the beating of the wings I would be more inclined to
believe the video.

There have been manned airplanes that achieve propulsion and lift with
flapping wings, such aircrafts are called "ornithopters".


There was even a human powered one; according to Wikipedia:
"On August 2, 2010, Todd Reichert of the University of Toronto Institute
for Aerospace Studies piloted a human-powered ornithopter named
Snowbird<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowbird_%28ornithopter%29>.
The 32 metres (105 ft 0 in) wingspan 42 kilograms (93 lb) aircraft was
constructed from carbon fibre <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fibre>,
balsa, and foam. The pilot sat in a small cockpit suspended below the wings
and pumped a bar with his feet to operate a system of wires that flapped
the wings up and down. Towed by a car until airborne, it then sustained
flight for almost 20 seconds. It flew 145 meters with an average speed of
25.6 km/h (7.1 m/s)
[10]<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornitopter#cite_note-9>Similar
tow-launched flights were made in the past, but improved data
collection verified that the ornithopter was capable of self-powered flight
once aloft.[11] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornitopter#cite_note-10>"

But it should be noted this one involved the pilot pushing with his legs
and couldn't take off by itself, i'm not sure if humans got the right
power/weight and endurance/weight ratios required to repeat that feat using
the arms...

As a brand-new fursuiter, I would like to learn how to create the most
charming character I can out of this fine creation. I originally planned
on creating a 90-second martial arts demo for in-costume performance, so
my character will probably employ some elements of martial arts. However
the focus has changed over the past couple years, and furry cons are no
longer a possibility. I'll probably get the chance to interact with the
public here in the Lansing, MI area but it'll have to be without a
handler. Events like pet store appearances, parades, kid-friendly local
festivals, etc.

Thus, I need to figure out some of the movements & motions that make a
character come to life in the friendliest, most endearing way possible.
Stuff that makes a child want to laugh & play, and a regular parent go
"Awww, that is a cool costume!", and makes an event organizer want to ask
me to return for the next event.

Marcwolf, I know you've done this stuff before. Have you figured out what
works and probably more importantly, what doesn't work?

Tenatively I have three events lined up for this summer & fall - One's a
for sure: A two hour morning session, assisting a clown at a local event
in late July.

'Never' is kinda broad.........
I'm a new suiter, too. Last year was my first year in costume; did three cons- FAU4, Anthrocon, and FurFright. Had a handler at all but Anthrocon. Going without a handler was a bit of a challenge, but I survived, and had a great time. Of course, Anthrocon is as fursuit friendly as a place can be. Broad hallways, good lighting, cool temperatures. I'm not sure I'd go out in public, at least not without the support of a group. Too easy to overheat, encounter a drunk, or a misbehaving child. If you're outside a facility, it's too easy to trip, and the places to take a headless break may not be apparant.
As to the performance, great question! With that wonderful suit, I'm sure everyone will go 'AWWWWW!' whatever you do.

As a personal suggestion, I would look on YouTube and study what other
fursuiters do, especially with encounters of the "small" kind (aka
children and possibly pets) and what I should do when approached by
these kinds of situations. Although they may have a handler with them
in a number of videos, the majority of them act on their own accord
and in some cases a handler won't always be quick to react to a
situation when it arises (has happened a couple of times to me).

While I'm still personally learning how to fursuit myself (only been
suiting for a couple of years now), there's still ways I'm learning to
improve on what I can do and visual aids from studying other
fursuiters through videos should surfice. :)

Y'know, I've been on youtube during the weekend and I went on and
watched fursuit bowling and as i watched some fursuiters go on and
bowl. Man, I still wish I had a fursuit.

lol By "never" I don't means cons ;) Conventions are usually like a safe haven to me where I feel I can relax and walk around or be a gooberhead and everything is alright. Out in the real world though is a different story. Just too many things that could potentially go 'wrong' at any moment -too many variables and unknowns. If I can't get a spotter or handler to go with me somewhere, then I just won't bother.

As a personal suggestion, I would look on YouTube and study what other
ursuiters do, especially with encounters of the "small" kind (aka
hildren and possibly pets) and what I should do when approached by
hese kinds of situations. Although they may have a handler with them
n a number of videos, the majority of them act on their own accord
nd in some cases a handler won't always be quick to react to a
ituation when it arises (has happened a couple of times to me).
While I'm still personally learning how to fursuit myself (only been
uiting for a couple of years now), there's still ways I'm learning to
mprove on what I can do and visual aids from studying other
ursuiters through videos should surfice. :)

Message-ID: <20120405.013229.1667.338437@mailpop06.vgs.untd.com>

Dear Doo Dah Parade Admirers, Lovers, and Participants:
 
In a little over three weeks it'll be time for the 35th Occasional
Pasadena Doo Dah Parade in Southern California!  This year it's on
Saturday the 28th of April and you're all invited to watch, help, or if
you have a fursuit, participate with us in East Pasadena!  Now in it's
third year on the new spring date, new meeting location, and new route in
East Pasadena.  Why they changed the date (for the third time) and
location I'll never know, but here's yer chance for some local fursuiting
fun that began with Thaddeus Fox and Rapid T. Rabbit way back in 1990
(yes, that's 22 years)!
 
Here's how to join in on the fun:
1) simply e-mail me (NOT this list) at dlely at juno.com telling me you'll
be there.  I will reply with confirmation giving you more details.
2) Check out the Parade's official web site at
http://www.pasadenadoodahparade.info/ for further information, maps,
news, and highlights from previous year's parades.
3) Then on Saturday the 28th of April: meet all of us furry participants
no later than 10:00 AM on shady Nina Street between North Altadena Drive
and North Vinedo Street just north of East Colorado Boulevard.
4) Pay your $10.00 per person entry fee to me who will then turn over the
total to the parade organizers (The Light Bringer Project - a nonprofit
arts organization - http://www.lightbringerproject.com).
5) Wait around and have some fun . . . then jump in the parade around
11:00 AM and have more fun being crazy, out of control, silly, wacky, and
zany to thousands of crazy, out of control, silly, wacky and zany
spectators lining both sides of East Colorado Boulevard in the 2500-2600

Would it really be put out for display where people can see it or just
put in some storage bin and forgotten?

Most of the stuff the museums get are filed away in some storage room
and forgotten. Every so often you hear a news story about some object
that is in a museums collection that no one remembered that it was
there. Just a few weeks ago there was a news report about some black
lady that was a great artist that was born a slave that her art work
was just rediscovered in some museums storage area somewhere.

The problem with a fursuit being stored away for decades it would
disintegrate because foam just does not hold up in the long term.

Sorry to be raining on your parade but I just don't see that a museum
would find enough general public interest in furry to be having a
fursuit out for public display.

There is something that somefur could do. Create an on line furry
museum showing the history of the furry fandom. Maybe someone has some
old photos from the first years of the fandom so furs can see how the
fandom has evolved though the decades. Maybe this could become a
regular presentation at a furry convention.

FWIW I bet Fred Patten's collection at UoC (the place we're talking 
about) would be a good start for an eventual online museum. According to 
his article on Wikifur he was visiting the library on a regular basis to 
organize the collection of works he donated, but this apparently was 
years ago and I don't know if it's organized or what.

But, if it's catalogued and documented, that is probably a good place to 
start for a researcher to put together an interesting online archive of 
fandom history. You just need somebody proactive enough to do something 
with it.

As I understand it, Fred visits on a monthly basis when he can (he's reliant on others for transportation). It's a big project! But they have already put up

I can't say. I know they did have a recent two-year exhibition of some of Fred's collection, and they have specifically asked for them, so I imagine they are interested in putting one on show, at least for a time.

Bear in mind that we're not talking about a general-purpose museum; it's a collection of science fiction and fantasy material, including ephemera such as costumes.

Don't see how that'd be much better than having it rot away in a closet somewhere. :-)

I don't know if there's any way to preserve the materials in a fursuit, but I imagine they'd have the appropriate resources to find out.

Chairo and others at FC/AAE have apparently been working on some aspects of that with the AFR:
http://www.flayrah.com/3967#comment-48765
It appears to be FC-specific - mostly because that's what they have to hand. It might be a start, though. 

Long-term, that's something I could imagine being involved in (though I can't provide much in the way of material), but should set up that 501(c)(3) furry foundation to run it first . . .

Yes, FC has the AFR, Anthro Fandom Repository. 

Most of the materials are flat file media. Zines, Books, Art, Etc.  Fred Patten has even donated to it in the past and I am sure will continue to be a great reaource for us and the fandom. Our goal as FC is to collect, archive, and share the Furry end of history. Not Just FC's.

We have had this archive for a good while and have recently restaffed much of our board and board staff including AFR librarians.

We hope to have something online soon. But it will take a while to scan and index everything.

It's all held in a safe climate controlled off site storage for now. We will be looking for new materials to add. Fursuits have not been discussed yet. We have videos from as far back as CF 4. And stills from a smattering of conventions and other events.

FC will most defiately have a display of their history at a future FurCon which may include some retro costumes and AFR items. My oldest fursuit so far is from 1997. Tho I know of several suits who have gone back even further. An item to consider for sure.

We will keep everyone posted and accept donations of all types of fandom related material in the mean time.

Cheers and Chirrs!

Chairo

I know a certain coyote who just retired his fursuit last year--but don't cry--he's still in the game. This would be a good place for it to go so others may appreciate it.

Hey there (whoevers left!)

   A Good friend of mine who has been filled in on Fursuiting (and the 
need for us to be able to clean in the suits between wears) found an 
interesting Non-Aerosol product which might help us out:

Designed for Incontinence, the product is called "Ca-Rezz", a No Rinse 
Wash, which "is Intended for Frequent Daily Use" and can be sprayed 
directly onto Skin, Pads, Linen, and Clothing."

   http://www.amazon.com/FNC-Medical-Ca-Rezz%C2%AE-Wash-Spray/dp/B001MUAB56

Has anyone else tried using this? I sure am going to give it a try!

Hello group,
Thanks for the help over the past year or two,

I just wanted to follow up with Marc Wolf, and others on the list who
helped me brainstorm how I could use my fursuit in the community setting.
Well, things seem to be taking off, perhaps almost uncomfortably fast, as
the last two events I attended, I couldn't actually find a way to get back
to a cooldown area until over two hours had passed... People are
fascinated with Tycho Aussie here in the area, especially the kids. I've
already been asked to return for the 2013 festival by our township's parks
& recreation director, and been interviewed for a feature on the local
cable TV station.

I'm trying to be a good ambassador, and offer up a sense of the whimsical
for all ages, and it's been almost intoxicating fun in every way. I have
had to rely heavily on my kids to be my eyes, water bearers, handlers, and
photographers, and they have risen to the challenge in such fine fashion.
I am so proud of them.

So tonight, I was awestruck to receive this link from the editor who is
putting the feature together on Tycho Aussie. I've personally never seen a
fursuiter in public, and until two months ago, never even seen a fursuit
(Other than Grubbs Grizzly's until mine arrived from Lilleah West's
Beastcub Creations. Then, tonight, I finally saw what Tycho Aussie looks
like when brought to life.

So here's the content that will become a feature on an award winning local
community news program. I think you might like it, even if it's rather
raw, without the finishing touches like the soundtrack or introduction
that you get from a finished program. Watch the reactions of delight from
the community: they are all I could hope for, and more. Lauren Ragan was
the videographer and editor, and this is her work at introducing Tycho to
our community.

This is an amazing piece!  Tycho, I think you make a good spokesman ^^
I would be delighted to meet you at some point.  Plan on going to any 
conventions with that suit?

Congrats, and keep up the good work!

I can totally see by your YouTube videos why people are fascinated,
you've been asked to return, and have been interviewed for a TV feature .
. . you are a natural performer!

and out.  Keep up the awesome job!

And you know, those whimsical intoxicating feelings are still as strong
for me today as they were when I first put on my own fursuit over 13
years ago!!

Ahhhhh, your signature motto makes a whole lot of sense now!

HI all,

 

got some movie footage from my trip to see Knightwolf the other week that
both he and I really want to share.  Im currently struggling to get this
edited however as its recorded in MP4 and it seems that my editing software,
Power Director 8, wont accept it as a recognisable format.  I have tried to
convert the video using the movie maker supplied with Windows since its the
only tool I have left, and its hanging on conversion.  This means I have
some nice footage of a bound and edged pup whilst getting a prostate massage
and cannot share it.

 

Does anyone have any suggestions for software I can use?  Where I can get
some?  I really would like to get this uploaded sometime.

 

Thanks all,

 

Rizzo

Hi all. Seems to be video season. I know I don't post often, but I had to share my latest fursuit adventure. While some of you are being upstanding members of the community and ambassadors of furdom, I guess I'm rolling around in the trash heep.,?literary, doing another punk rock video. Friends of mine asked me help with their latest music video, after seeing me in The Briefs movie. I supplied fursuits and puppets, got to?perform, getting alot ?of camera time. I also had input in the video shoot. This is my first experience with green screen, it was interesting. The band, The Fun Police, are a punk / americana band from Tacoma Washington , their videos are DIY as you can see,?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo1Av06eF8?.
I would like your input here, and so would the band on YouTube.

Thanks
Rocky
aka Rocker Raccoon

I know you sent this to the wrong mailing list and already apologized and whatnot, but I figured I'd recommend a video converter anyways. Mpeg Streamclip does a wonderful job and it's free.  I'm a film student and this is my go-to software when I need to get files into the right format for my editing software. You can download it for either Mac or Windows here. http://www.squared5.com/
Best of luck,

Im currently struggling to get this edited however as its recorded in MP4 and it seems that my editing software, Power Director 8, wont accept it as a recognisable format.  I have tried to convert the video using the movie maker supplied with Windows since its the only tool I have left, and its hanging on conversion.  This means I have some nice footage of a bound and edged pup whilst getting a prostate massage and cannot share it.

I have received several emails from people inquiring about converting filetypes and what not. 
Mpeg Stream Clip works well but I tried it on some of the formats people have been having trouble with and got mixed results. I figured I would recommend another converter that seems to work a little better and produce better results than Mpeg has been having. Hand Brake does essentially the same thing as Mpeg Stream clip but I just tested both pieces of soft ware and had better luck with Hand Brake. Hope this helps someone and feel free to email me any further questions.

I know some people use this type of stuff for foam heads. I dunno if it's still popular at all or not. Has anyone used these sprays for fursuit heads that have the foam inside the head covered by cotton/lycra for comfort?

Yes, it's still used. The Walmart-brand disinfectant spray is just as effective as Endbac, cheaper, and easier to fine. It's used on both suits and heads, including foam heads. Let the head air out after spraying before wearing though. The best thing would to be to spray the inside of the head after use and let it air out overnight before wearing it again.  I personally don't use any sprays since I'm allergic to them.

Duncan and I use Misty 2 disinfectant/deodorant spray. It smells a lot nicer than Endbac and works very well! Duncan's fursuit head is foam and his other fursuit head (Evil Duncan) is foam with a balaclava. 

 Here is what it looks like: http://www.samsclub.com/sams/shop/product.jsp?productId=prod340304&refcd=GL05251200010023&pid=_CSE_Google_PLA_Janitorial&ci_src=17588969&ci_sku=sku644673 Many different sites sell it at various prices.

I just made a big post about this over on fursuit LJ..

First thing to know..  Endbac, or any of the clones, use propellants that are the solvants that are used to make foam rubber..   so everytime you spray your foam head with endbac, you slowly disintegrate the foam.  I have lost a couple of my earlier heads within a couple years of use, via dilligent use of endbac. Also, it says right on those cans, to only use on non-pourous surfaces.   You are putting extreme germ killers in direct contact with your face when they soak into the fabrics and foams of your head.  They are not very healthy for you.

Alternative #1   mix isopropal (rubbing) alcohol and water (50-50 mix)  and spray that inside the head to kill the ickies.  It will evaporate fast, and is less toxic for you.

second product, see here:

Lysol works pretty good too.  And if your suit is dry enough after a night
of wear at a con, febreeze can be a quick fresher too.

I know Endbac comes in an non-aerosol liquid.  Found this out I stopped into a local Janitorial supply house looking for the spray can and all they had was a jug of endbac or something similar. Wonder if something like this would work?-  http://www.metrex.com/surface-MetriGuard  Wally_Wabbit

What is so bad about it? It doesn't end up being the typical "furries are fetish freaks!" documentaries we usually see all over the Internet and television. If you think you could do a better film, get a camera and start filming and directing!

I am not a collage student that has been taking classes for years in how to
make a film.

Despite that I am not in collage learning how to create a film I think that
I could not do any worse at acting or directing.

<http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Bitter_Lake>The furry film "Bitter Lake" was
created by furs that had never acted or directed before they made their
film and "Bitter Lake" came out a great deal better.

I am sorry that I forgot to change the subject line. I did correct that.

Agreed on Bitter Lake!
My biggest 2 sticklers on the film:

The sword fight left a bad taste in my mouth.

But the BIG one is this:
If you watch the making of the film, he put a metric-ton of effort into sounds.
YET!
Why does not 1 bit of dialogue have any "room ambiance" effects on them?
All talking sounds like they are in a studio, not outside or in a room.

Otherwise, I loved it.

Subject: FL: Bad furry collage student film
 

I am not a collage student that has been taking classes for years in how to make a film. 

Despite that I am not in collage learning how to create a film I think that I could not do any worse at acting or directing.

The furry film "Bitter Lake" was created by furs that had never acted or directed before they made their film and "Bitter Lake" came out a great deal better. 

I am sorry that I forgot to change the subject line. I did correct that.

I agree that Bitter Lake was a bit disappointing on some parts of it. 
Nonetheless, it's easy to criticize others, but I don't think it's fair 
when we can't do better ourselves :/

I'm not judging anyone here, i'm just saying, until I see a "perfect 
furry movie", this one stays the best i've ever seen so far. More time, 
effort and skill than in any other i've seen made by furry amateurs to 
date :)

Actually that's perftectly fair and legitimate.

 You don't need to have run a fortune 500 company to realize the Enron was a pathetic failure in every moral or fiscal scale in which you can judge a company.

 If a fancy restaurant serves you a literal cat turd the chef could say "How many years did YOU study at the Cordon Bleu institute?" but that won't turn what's on your plate into not-a-cat-turd.

 We are all capable of judging things relative to our expreience in related subjects.

 Being both furries and, presumably, people who have watch other movies in our lives, we are capable of analyzing a movie, weighing its features and shortcomings and comparing it relative to other movies and our life experience.

 Even if I did make a movie and even if my movie were terrible the movie in question would remain at it is, to be judged on its own merits. You may say it's the best you've seen so far but best does not logically correlate to good or even anywhere inthe the mediocre bell curve or better.

 Logic implies that even terrible things will have a "best" by virtue of being least worst. There is a best Uwe Boll movie, a best ethnic genocide, a best quarapeligic martial artist and in the cases where the total set of qualified items is one the best must also be the worst.

 If someone does not like this movie they have their reasons. You're free to inqure to, debate and discuss those reasons but don't trry to serve up a cat turd then act like we're the ones who did something wrong.

Most high school students can spell "college", and know the difference between that and "collage".

With the swod fight. It's very difficult to do a Errol Flynn sword-fight when one has very limited vision. You have to chorograph everything  even then there will be gaps because the actors cannot fully compensate with the vision.

 

 

I thought that Bitter Lake was a great movie and that in many ways it was a pioneer of furry movies to come.

 

Take Care

They may not be furries at all. Their really crappy costumes say they are
not furs. The costumes they used where eather rented or badly thrown
together. I mean really, what fur in their right mind would spend $2,000 on
a fursuit as really crappy as that wolf costume?

What they are are college students that are making a film for their college
degree.

If it was just furs putting together a film about being a fur I would not
have broght it up. I broght it up because they are college students that
are trying to make a film for their college degree.

Err. Donkey.

Are we talking the same movie "Bitter Lake". Did you see the making of it
and the preparation that went into it?.

 

The costumes are from Clockwork Creatures  http://www.clockworkcreature.com/
which I would classify as a producer of high quality suits.  Which wolfsuit
were you taking about as there were 2.  Colonel Raden Drraer who was the
black wolf and Prince Arden who was the white/brown wolf

 

The makers are not college students but are all professionals working in the
industry who collaberated to make a Furry movie. Maybe it was not on the
same level as Avatar but then again they did not have hollywood funding or
the huge team of specialists

 

Have a read of the their website and it has a lot of information on the
makers, the suit, and the details. http://bitterlakethemovie.com/

 

It's easy to belittle other's achievements without even thinking of what it
takes to do the same yourslef.  I have nothing but the highest praise for
the team who made Bitter Lake and look forward to what else that can do.

You want to see what they do to make a decent photo of the Colonel? Have a
look at this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_ALxwhMlj8

 

And no - I am not associated in anyway with the makers

I think constructive criticism is much needed.? Even if this was probably the best furry movie to date, it is important to be careful not to just slap a 10/10 rating on it and say it was perfect.?

That school project, I actually loved.  It might have been corny and
done with the lowest budget ever, but it had a lot of heart.

The costumes are from Clockwork Creatures  http://www.clockworkcreature.com/

were you taking about as there were 2.  Colonel Raden Drraer who was the
black wolf and Prince Arden who was the white/brown wolf

 

The makers are not college students but are all professionals working in the

Have a read of the their website and it has a lot of information on the

It's easy to belittle other's achievements without even thinking of what it

You want to see what they do to make a decent photo of the Colonel? Have a

They may not be furries at all. Their really crappy costumes say they are
not furs. The costumes they used where eather rented or badly thrown
together. I mean really, what fur in their right mind would spend $2,000 on
a fursuit as really crappy as that wolf costume?

What they are are college students that are making a film for their college
degree. 

If it was just furs putting together a film about being a fur I would not
have broght it up. I broght it up because they are college students that are
trying to make a film for their college degree.

First of all, not everyone can  afford the finest Rolls Royce brand
costumes.  So to say just because their costumes weren't top-notch
points to them not being furries, is pretty rude.  Look around local
furmeets and things where everyone tries to make their own.  It's
pretty obvious that Latin Vixen didn't make every single suit in the
furry population.  Also, they are a bunch of kids.  If you look in the
credits, the wolf costume was made by one of the students.  Pretty
good suit for someone that probably doesn't make them.

Secondly, if someone told you to make a movie about furries in a
semester, you're obviously not going to get a dozen of Beastcub's
finest quadsuits in that length of time.  Especially if you have been
living off of instant ramen and easy-mac the rest of the time.  I
would rent a bunch of random $100 animal costumes too.  The
cinematography, writing, and technical stuff was the point of getting
the grade.

Right, which is why we should be happy someone tried to do a positive,
believable scenario about furries, rather than a "yiff in hell
furfags" expose.  ESPECIALLY if they're not furries.  I support these
dudes, 100%.

We actually interviewed the producer/director of the college film project on Funday Pawpet Show a couple weeks ago.  It was interesting to hear her perspective, and how they went about making it..  After the interview, the film itself makes a lot more sense from where they were coming from.  And yes, the college film was limited to like a $5k budget, so fursuit budget had to be kept under control, and the timeline they had to work with, did not allow them to wait 10 years to get a big name costume.

http://pawpet.tv/episode_555    if you want to catch the interview.  we showed the movie at 1:00, and the interview at about 1:20.

yeah I remember that I was in channel and watching your show when you did a phone interview w/her. and for the Bitter Lake one they only worked with what they got and made very little props to help support the location of the scenes and they did some of it at night fall, and they made their own weapons, and rehearsed on how whomever it was suppose to die, cuz I saw a few of Behind the scenes of Bitter Lake.

I had a chance to catch up with the  College movie and I have to agree with
Yappy here. It's a nice simple cute movie. Sure the costumes were not the
best but the owners wore them with pride as THEIR creations. 

Comparing between Bitter Lake and Furry I can make the following points.

Bitter Lake was a furry movie that was creating the illusion that the world
populated by different furkin was real. Wolves, Foxes, and other types lived
just as we live in our world. Certainly if the costumes the producers used
were the same as in the Furry movie then the illusion of disbelief would
have fled quickly.

Furry was a movie about Furries, and how they live, have fun, and find love
and acceptance in the real world.  In truth - when we pull on our fursiuts
we become the dashing, amazing characters that is our furry side.
Imagination is the key to this as you can ask any kid wearing a pirate hat
who beliefs for a short time that they are Capt Jack Sparrow. Sure it's only
a hat and a plastic sword but it's the energy and fun that is driving it to
make it real.

So - two different movies, two different viewpoints on the world, but both
can be called Furry.
And folks - isn't that the dilemma with being Furry - it meansing something
different to each of us.

Marc.

studio as a range on on-line video's (or you can purchase them) on a range
of tropics from  Cable control (tails, tenticles) , animatronic controls,
hair punching ans basically anything else you are intersting in.

 

The prices are pretty good.  $49.95 per month for a subscription to all
video's, or $19.95 per video (unlimited)

You can also buy the DVD's.  Each lession is about 2.5 hours long broken
into chapters, and they are aimed at the semi competent experimentor.. By
that I mean they don't teach you how to drill or cut. It is assumed that you
know what a workshop is and  ow to do basic skills.

 

Anyway - I'm currently watching the cable one and its fantatastic

 

Take Care

Antimon, I think your account has been hacked. Got 3 email from you, 2 on the list and one directly to me. I think you need to run a virus scan and change your password.

It's fun to wonder what kind of product might fit this description yet be suitable for promotion here - costume timeshares? Some kind of bovine fursuit? The mind boggles . . .

Not quite sure what to make of the last line, yet alone whether I'd want to be one of those people. O_o

Personally, I'd block all mail from gmail, and yahoo, just like lists used
to block everything from aol and hotmail.  The problem with these email
services is that they are free and used by so many people, so they will
always attract the spammers.  If people would simply use the email address
provided by their own ISPs, most of this type of spam would vanish.

My ISP is my landlord. I don't have access to the underlying account.

95% of the time, the problem is that people are using terribly short or easy 
passwords and having their accounts taken over. Secure yourself, people!

My ISP doesn't provide an email, it is just an access provider, not an
email provider. A few years ago there was actually quite some fuss over
here about it; in the end the law decided in favor of the consumers, now
over here we can choose any content provider we want, even none; before
that we were forced to pay extra and sign in with one of the content
providers that were partners of the access provider; some access providers
even tried to lie and say the content provider was a technical necessity in
order for the consumer to be able to reach the Internet and after people
caught on they even tried actually modifying their systems to make their
lie a reality.

The irony in that statement is AOL was an ISP :)

People use G-mail cus it blocks spam better then earthlink and yahoo etc in 
addition to the cost benefit.  Plus the intergration into Android.

it's mostly the password thing, but even then not so much.

Blocking those providers isn't the answer too many people use them that 
would be an immensely interfering barrier to the usage of the list.

For the record when I spammed the list it was my ISP email, earthlink that 
did it, not my gmail.

I think we just need to deal for now, if you can't recognize spam when you 
see it....you shouldn't be on a mail list

is there  a filter key we can implement, where messages will get auto 
rejected if a keyword isn't present in subject or body?

Message-ID: <15927728.1349647000847.JavaMail.root@elwamui-little.atl.sa.earthlink.net>

I am currently shopping for a new washing machine.  From past experience, I know that front loaders are great for washing a fursuit.  They are gentle and you do not have to worry about some agitator like you do on the old top loaders.

What I am curious about are the new high efficiency top loaders.  These machines do not have a center agitator either.  Have any of you ever washed your fursuit in one of these new machines?

Hi Michel

Look for that one -

14KG drum and the maschine weights the wash and calculates how much water it
needs.
No matter you put 1KG or 14KG in

I chuck a Complete mascot suit in that -

I was watching The James Bond movie Moonraker and there is a band wearing
fursuits at about 1:03:00 into the movie

Yes, but it might be more annoying to some users than the small amount of
spam this list gets.  Requiring fur* somewhere in the subject or body could
prevent a lot of the spam.  The problem is that it would reject valid mail
from users who forgot to use the word.

I think a better idea would be to auto-reject anything that is CC:'d to
more than three or four addresses at a time.  Such a filter would block
most of the spam, with little to no impact on normal use.  It wouldn't be
perfect, but I haven't seen too many single-recipient spams on mailing
lists lately.  There's nearly always a block of 10 to 30 mostly gmail and
yahoo addresses in the header.

Personally, I'd be happy with a drier that uses a humidistat instead of
a timer.

Hi Folks

I am currently making an underskull that I will need to put a foam covering.

Now - I don't have a large over so foam latex will be an issue, plus latex
tends to decay after a while.

I have seen some cold 2 part foam and was wondering if anyone has any
experience with it.

Many thanks
Marc
