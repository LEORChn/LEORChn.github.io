Already a third connection for me!

I put all my furry stuff on LinkedIn as relevant experience. I figure I 
won't miss the kind of employers who might be put off by it.

Subject: FL: Fursuiting at parks/landmarks?
Message-ID: <9E8914A3B51D46C5AEB94C8A531B3224@Phineas>

I want to see how many pictures I could get in fursuit in front of various famous parks or landmarks, e.g. the Statue of Liberty, Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, etc. ...Or if it is worth trying.

Has anybody fursuited at places like these in the U.S. or elsewhere? Was it a partial or full suit? I?m looking for tips on places that are not difficult to suit up at, or particularly where I will not find myself attempting to outrun teams of burly security officers. :)

For instance, I had attempted to do the Statue of Liberty last weekend, and it turned out I hadn?t done enough research first: Large bags are not allowed, and you must pass through airport style security before boarding the ferries, making this photo difficult or impossible to get (at least with a full suit). (http://www.nps.gov/stli/planyourvisit/things2know.htm )

Any ideas, suggestions? Thanks!

I don't have cable any longer, but my mother does and she told me
about a commercial she saw on TLC for an episode of "My Strange
Addiction" airing next Wednesday night (1/19/2011).  This episode
is going to feature a segment about a girl (identified only as 
Lauren A.) who is addicted to fursuits.

I checked the website and found this rather short write-up about
the episode with a single picture:

http://tlc.discovery.com/tv/my-strange-addiction/episode-guide-13.html

I know nothing about the show or how it treats these subjects, but 
I thought I'd share the information in case anyone is curious, has
cable, and wants to watch it and report back here.

Cheers,
Santa Fox

This sounds like a case where you are just going to have to make a special 
arrangement with the Park Service.

SeaWolf, YotieCoyote and I suited at the Grand Canyon last June. There are so many observation areas, that you just drive to the one that interests you, park, change in the car, and get out for photos. There are no security checks. We didn't stay very long at any one site, and it was mainly for photos, though one area had a lot of families with kids and they all wanted photos.

This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System.

If this was a true emergency I would not be here wasting my time warning
you. I would be on my own way to safety with out giving you the opportunity
to get in my way to save my own butt.

This concludes our test of the Emergency Broadcast System.

MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!

This is a test of the emergency Ferret System.

This ferret,
in voluntary coordination with the FCC and other Federal Agencies,
has developed this system to keep you informed in case of an emergency.
In case of an /actual/ emergency, I would have RUN AWAY! FLEE!

This concludes this test of the emergency Ferret System.
Thank you berry much.

MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!

This is a test of the emergency Ferret System.

This ferret,
in voluntary coordination with the FCC and other Federal Agencies,
has developed this system to keep you informed in case of an emergency.
In case of an /actual/ emergency, I would have RUN AWAY! FLEE!

This concludes this test of the emergency Ferret System.
Thank you berry much.

I know this is a bit early in the year to be thinking about summertime, but
was curious how many of you (if any) were thinking about going to Califur?
I've never been to this one before, and I'm wondering what it is like.

If you're not traveling all that far its a OK con. Like most smaller cons
its better for people that live in the area that are going to hang out with
ones friends than going for the programing that the con is running. The
programing highlights of califur are the ice cream social, the slave
auction, and the Cabaret. That may have changed I have not gone for years.
The down side of califur are that things start late quite often and not
always because of technical issues but because of staff drama.

If you live in the southwest and can drive to califur you might just want to
go to see what its like. If you would need to fly in you might just want to
give it some more thought. If you would have to come into the USA I would
highly suggest going to FC or AC instead.

I've fursuited at a few US National Park units including Grand Canyon
National Park

In all cases I knew the Park well - that is, I knew the layout of
everything, the roads, parking lots, busy and popular spots, busy and
popular times, private concessionaire facilities, and government
facilities.  I then took all of that and decided whether or not it would
be a safe and prudent idea to fursuit in a specific area.  I have never
fursuited, nor would I recommend ever fursuiting, in a concessionaire
facility like a gift shop or a government facility like a Visitor Center.
 Instead I prefer the outdoors where I knew I would not disturb folks
working and conducting business.  Besides fursuiting in the outdoors
allows for some pretty awesome photos!  In addition I always fursuited
with an escort and would dress in a hotel room or my own home if I lived
there.  Before leaving we would discuss where exactly we would go, for
how long, and what to do if the officials did not want us there.  Then
the escort would drive me and/or my friend(s) to the predetermined spot
and have our fun.  In all of the National Parks I've fursuited so far
I've never run into any trouble and in fact was met with smiles, open
arms, and flashes of camera lights - and that included Park Rangers!

In the case of your example of the Statue of Liberty, I can understand
the heightened security you found since this is a well known and popular
American symbol visited by thousands of tourists every day.  In the
future I would be hesitant about fursuiting at a National Park location
that is a shrine, an icon, a memorial, a museum, a hall, a mall, a
battlefield, an historical site, and the like.  If in doubt about what
you'll find there check out the Park in question by visiting the
individual Park's official web site off of http://www.nps.gov/index.htm. 
If you need to call an official there to get some straight answers you'll
find the phone number(s) listed on the main page.

Have fun in your National Parks and add to the continuing list of furs
who have done so in fursuit from coast to coast!

This reminds me of about 15 years ago when myself and Thaddeus Fox along 
with Buster Bear (aka Mascot Matt, back when we were still friends and helping 
each other out) were in costume and visited the Liberty Bell in Phiadelphia.
 
In costume  I could hear one of the National Park Service officers calling 
up on his radio,
"Hello we have several mascots, costume characters here...what's our 
status?"
Nothing came of it, we stayed just long enough to hear the historical 
speech and then left.
 
With regards to the Statue of Liberty, some years ago I was doing a Scooby 
Doo appearance in Battery Park adjacent to the ferry landing and got shooed 
away from the line of tourists waiting to board the boat.
 
As New York City's first and longest-running (since 1986) fursuiter, I 
pretty much have a good idea of where suiting would be relatively safe in my 
hometown (so ask me first!), and I avoid any places that may have security 
issues or restrictions, and approach private property (like Rockefeller Center) 
with caution.  That number of places has been sort of in a perennial state 
of flux since 9/11 plus also changes in view of surrounding times, events or 
other circumstances.  Amazingly enough though, in suit I still get on 
subways, regional buses and trains (but not Amtrak--anymore) though I don't do 
that nearly as much as most folks think I do, and only on certain routes.
 
It's a real shame that real (i.e. celebrity) costume character performing 
in New York City is essentially a privalege as opposed to a right, restricted 
to those that have showbiz or corporate connections, and on the other end 
of the spectrum, Times Square and Midtown in recent years has mimicked 
Hollywood in attracting rogue costume-wearing folks who only seek to hustle 
tourists for tips instead of entertaining.
 
A really good public event to fursuit at is the one that I've been doing 
the longest...the annual Easter Parade on 5th Avenue.

That's pretty awesome! I fursuited in Times Square last month.

Tried to do Central Park, but 20" of snow was just dumped on it so it was 
unpleasant enough to explore, let alone get in fursuit. :) I'll try again in 
warmer months perhaps. Would be neat to get a photo with the Balto statue.

Well, it?s the trudging through freezing slush and mud until your fursuit paws, socks, and tailtip are soaked through in icy yuck! What do you think this is, a walk in the park? ...Oh wait... *grins*

 The funny thing is?
 It was in the 100's when I was Central Park, and eventhough it was 
 night time at Times Square, it was still high 80's.

 DON'T suit in NYC in JULY!!  Durrr!!

I am looking for a fursuit head to be built that I am not up to doing my
self. If someone knows of someone that can make what I am looking for please
have them contact me of give me there contact info.

What I am looking for is,

I want a pig head that is skin tight aka no bulk other than the snout that
is not absolutely needed.

I want it as realistic as possible.

My eyes are the suits eyes.

I must be able to eat with little difficultly wail wearing it. None of my
current heads I can eat wail I am wearing them. the idea for this head is
when I am at a furry convention and want to go out to eat to a restraint I
will not have to go with out wearing a fursuit.

I am quite aware of rubberdog that is not what I am looking for. I don't
want something that is made out of rubber well at least looks like its
rubber. I would consider leather if the stitches could not bee seen. I dont
want the saw pig or a BDSM look.

I have never seen that before. It looks good but I don't want anything
made out of latex. I want something that will not fall apart in a
matter of years and that's what latex does even if you keep it out of
UV. Thanks for bringing that to my attention.

Not sure you can get a "no bulk no snout" realistic pig muzzle in cloth.
 There will be some bulk to it due to the foam or what ever is used to
maintain it's shape.

 I know, I know. 

Actually that Composite Effects one is silicone, thus the high price. That's why I sent you the link.

Silicone is much more durable than latex since it contains no organic components which could rot. It also doesn't "dry up" like latex, it's more flexible and resistant to temperature changes and U.V. exposure. Silicone does not decay when exposed to certain oils like latex could, which means you can eat greasy food in it and not have to worry.

Big changes are coming.  I am going to seal and time capsule the 15 year old FAQ and lock it from any future editing.

It seems that it has grown stagnant and outdated.

With that, I have started a full overhaul of the Fursuit.org website.

Some additions and changes:

User profiles:
  I have created profile fields such as journal and blog entries, birthdays, websites and other personal stuffs.  The big one I have added is a "Professional" entry, that will let you builders state that you do commisions.  This will come into play, where there is a link to "Builders"  which will list off all the builders, and if they are open for business and such.
If there are other profile feilds you wish to see, let me know..  I intend to keep expanding this, and it is quite easily done.

You will be able to manage your mail list subscription, right from the web site.  No more having to email the mail server.

Links to other popular fursuit related websites and journals.

Classified Ads!  You can post up links to auctions or direct sales of fursuits/parts

There is a project being developed, by the people who run Wikifur..  to create a fursuit wiki once again, but using fresh data, and using the interface that people are already familiar with.

The ability to add other maintainers and moderators..  to expand options.

What will happen next...

each one of you subscribed to the mail list will get an email probably tonight, with a link to the new site.  With this link you will be able to create a password on the new site, and then edit all your personal profile information.

If there are options you wish to see, I have added a forum to allow you to ask for features you wish to see!

 hey Yappy, can I beg ONE thing?

 PLEASE don't have THREE MOVING BANNERS at the top of each page! That's 
 HIGHLY annoying.
 One that changes every 30 seconds or something would be better.

 Other than that, its looking nice.

yeah  I was just formatting the layout, and just leaving space for 3 ads, but since there are no builder ads yet, I'll keep it down to 1 for now..  If there is a higher count, I'll add more..  and yes  they will be set for 30sec.

I saw Abbott and Costello Meets Dr Heckyll and Mr Hyde. Costello is
put into a really great mouse partial fursuit for the era. I would say
its nice looking even for what people are making today. The only thing
that I have bad to say about it was that they did not glue down the

I've always been fond of this silent film era pig suit from "Le cochon danseur".

It has some very impressive gimmicks and a good overall design, even if it's a bit disturbing.

I didn't know anything when I made my first suit.  I just did some
research online first (and this was in 1996 when it wasn't as easy).
I taught myself how to sew and did the whole suit by hand for $100 in
materials.  I highly recommend it.

I remember I had it on my old computer. I could not find it on my current one. 

Good thing I back up my files regularly. I found it on a ZIP disk from 2004 and uploaded it for you (and any other fursuiters who want to see it).

This thread is the first time I have ever seen this, or even heard of it for
that matter.  Then again, I did grow up a very sheltered suburban USA white
boy.  Thankfully I'm not anywhere near as sheltered now-a-days but I'm still
just as white. :-P

Thank you for sharing this, as I do like to learn about new things.

It's probably okay to post this to this group, but I've got a deposit on
one of her costumes though it's still pretty iffy if I will go though with
it. Tentative construction is planned for late 2011. Right now, I am
thinking of just going for it, even as an investment. I too, think her
costumes are world-class and will eventually be recognized as the artwork
that they are.

I am not anywhere close to being a furry; I just fell in love with the
concept of performing in fursuit. There's no one in my immediate circle of
friends who does anything close to this, so it isn't even on anyone's
radar. My wife doesn't want me to spend any money on it, feels like it's a
waste of money & time. However I sold my guitars, a pile of motorcycle
spare parts, two sets of race tires, plus saved for 18 months, so
everything's there and it doesn't impact the family finances at all.
There's also no debt in our household to which I need to put this money.

I'm putting together a 90-second combined Extreme martial arts / dance
routine & want to perform it in fursuit. I've got a choreographer who has
agreed (in principle) to assist with helping me with the music & dance
portions. I've even joined TaeKwon-Do, lost 25 pounds practicing for this,
and will have a 1st degree black belt about the time the suit gets done. I
can do 88 pushups, plus handstands & cartwheels for the first time in my
life, at age 46.  I'm down to my old high school weight and waist size. So
just the idea of a suit performance , and preparing for it has already
changed my life. I just don't know if actually going through with it will
be as rewarding as the actual vision itself. I'm afraid I might look silly
and need to ensure that it goes great the first time, because I fear that
there won't be a second chance if it bombs.

Anyone have any ideas or insight on if this is a good idea or not??

 The character name is Tycho and the character is a blue merle Australian 
shepherd / collie mix. Extensive airbrushing, multiple length piles, blue
merle, white, & copper colors, two sets of feet & paws: One set for
general suiting, and one for martial arts demos on mats & stage.

I would do it!  This is coming from me as a performer, and not as a
furry. (which of course, I joined furry because I enjoy performing as
a mascot!)  Think of how fun it would be.  And what an impressive
video you'd make!

I like the idea of it you have more guts then me .I would like to have a
suit to perform for kids party and stuff like that.

I think you have a vision, and you should follow through on it. Even if it 
doesn't work out exactly as you plan, the memories will be priceless. *grin*

Besides, it already appears to have had a positive effect. Your wife should

Message-ID: <26708.2681.qm@web180301.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Only 2 more weeks until Morphicon (www.morphicon.org)?in Columbus, OH.? Morphicon provides several great opportunities to show off your fursuit, whether it's partial or full, paw-made or purchased.? 
?
On Friday night, there will be a competitive Masquerade that will be judged by experienced costumers.??If you made your fursuit yourself, you can wear or bring it to Pre-Judging and be eligible for the construction awards.? You can then show off your suit on stage during the Masquerade performance and be eligible for more awards.? If you purchased or borrowed your suit, or just don't want to be judged for construction, you're still eligible for the performance, "Best Use of Con Theme", and "Best in Show"?awards.? All acts should be 2 minutes or less.? If you don't have an act or your own music, we have thousands of songs for you to dance to on stage.
?
Then on Saturday afternoon, there will be a fursuit parade through the convention space that will end outside?on the patio with a group picture.? Parts of the route will go outside; however, if it's raining, the route will be shortened to stay inside.? There will be many opportunities along the route for picture-taking.
?
We also have a large fursuiting track with a wide variety of topics, such as performing on stage and fursuiting as another gender.? The schedule is online at http://www.morphicon.org/schedule.php.
. 
If you have any questions or would like to help in any way,?please email masquerade at morphicon.org.

Subject: FL: motor actuated eyes  - any design examples?
Message-ID: <63e58a980964defe457382eb5f497c60.squirrel@emailmg.startlogic.com>

I am experimenting with PIC microprocessors and I have a full motor
control development kit here on my desk. I can use it to control stepper
motors and DC motors, plus use MOSFETs for dumping high current loads to
other DC actuators as necessary. I'd like to develop a stand-alone,
closed-loop dual-channel controller for the actuation of costume eyelids.
One of the possibilities is to use some of today's semiconductor
non-contact switch designs to monitor the human eye, and when the human
eye blinks, to actuate the mechanical eye. Three potentiometers will
enable me to easily "tune" the design for blink sensitivity, eyelid
attack, and decay, with a result of an eye that blinks as fast as possible
with minimal bounce.

The actuated eye has been done before. However what I do not know is the
mechanics of how it's done; whether or not the lid is spring loaded, on a
shaft which is held in single shear or double shear, and whether or not
the lid is coupled directly on the motor shaft, or if it's actuated with
some form of lever/linkage.

Does anyone have pictures or drawings that show the mechanics of how the
eye lids are constructed, and where the placement of the motor is inside
the mask? I need to get an idea about the volume & dimensions of the motor
space, in order to figure out what size & type of motor to go with.

Interesting idea.

Re monitoring the eye blink - try shining a  IR led towards the eye and
reading the reflectivity.
The eyelid would have a far lower reflextivity than  the eye surface.

Spring loaded lid's are an issue - 

Firstly the design tends to be fairly complex, and secondly the tuning of
the unit is more critical

There are several high speed servo's used for ailirons  on glider and other
small planes that would work well, and you can use the lever principle
(small movement one end - large movement the other) to increase the speed.
Plus with a servo you can have the eyelids close half way, squint etc.

Hope this helps

Hey there everyone,

I just got a project that requires an airbrush.

I am looking for the best equipment I can get that will work with our friend, fur.

I also am looking for the proper paint/dye, combos, dilutions, etc. I need to do spots for now that won't bleed with heat or sweat and that won't transfer to others (hugs n such).

I've already got plenty of compressors. May need a filter tho.

Chirr and thanks!!

You do realize that all you are doing is painting the fur? What ever you use
is just coating the fur and not penetrating into the fur. In time it will
wear off and if you wash the suit the dye will mostly wash off and you will
have to reapply the dye.

Ok, I've had a few drama's with cutting the fur on the side of the suit panels (the 10mm seam allowence) with fur/ hair clippers around the perimeter with not much success. As I want to overlock the lining to the fur panel any pile over 15mm was a bugga to do!
 
Even though I've a 5 thread overlocker,  it still looks below par.
 
I just got some Duckbill scissors (for machine embroidery) that look like mini sheep shearing shears and am totally stoked.
 
Also as I've got a safety sticth on my overlocker with a 10mm seam allowence, I then use this as a guide to stitch each panel together.
 
 
Hope this saves alot of hassle, and can also be used for alot of other stuff too!!!
 
 I havent said  much for a while, but I'm till around the place.

Subject: FL: Skin protection while suiting?
Message-ID: <9522A69631B546CCB8D0E28D46F0DAFE@fensys.com>

Hi all. If this is a repeat topic, please forgive me.

Lately I've had skin irritation after suiting for a while (usually at 
conventions after I've been performing for a long time), presumably just 
from prolonged contact with the sweat on my face. I know that sweat needs to 
evaporate to cool the body and dispel toxins. It might only happen if I 
fursuit soon after shaving but I'm not sure.

I'm looking for advice that focuses on keeping my skin healthy and 
comfortable while fursuiting, with fursuit care as a lower priority. Taking 
more breaks and fursuiting less often will obviously help, but I'm wondering 
if anybody uses head gear (balaclavas, under armour, etc) specifically to 
protect their skin. I know they're often used to protect your costume and to 
keep your body cool, but I don't know how well they work to keep your skin 
dry as well. Does it help?

Any advice is appreciated.

Thanks!

I have found I break out as well, and a few things I have done.

Definetly the salts from the sweating, when built up , does tend to
irritate..  So I take my head, at least once a year (sometimes 2
depepnding on use)  and I just dunk the whole thing in fresh water do
rinse out and dilute the sweat.  I apply a bit of detergent to the water,
shampoo is what I use, since it rinses out easier than most detergents. I
rinse it quite liberally, then (since mine are foam heads)  I'll squeeze
wring them a bit, without distorting them too much.  After that, I'll set
it on a fan for a couple days, and it will dry right up.

As for immediete break outs, I found definetly during my 100 hour marathon
at AC, that I applied 1%Hydrocortizone cream to my face, and that cut down
on my break outs.  I applied before, and then after getting out of suit.

I suspect using a balaclave, that you can wash frequelty would also help,
keeping a fresh linen barrier that you can wash more than the head itself.

Wiping out the inside with a washcloth and warm soapy water. Then drying with a boot dryer or hose-type hair dryer.

Many suiters wear "under armor" to avoid friction burn from activity in the suit. Others wear zentai suits, leotard & tights, unitard, or a dive skin.

Washing the suit with wolite after ware will reduce irritation as well.  So
will bathing before and after.  Hygiene is very important, even while
Suiting.

PRE-REG ENDS TOMORROW AT MIDNIGHT!!!!!
Don?t miss the MFM that is going to be legendary!!!! Pre-reg for MFM 15 now at  http://www.mephitfurmeet.org because it ends August 1st!! Registering now makes sure you get all your goodies at the con and not have to wait for them!

MFM 15 ? Under Construction - Building a better MFM for the future!!!

JOURNAL ENTRY - 
The following excerpts were found on Wolfpaws's online journal, in the order listed. Oddly enough the system admins cannot decipher how things were posted out of order and state it was not due to a system issue.

Saturday, August 16, 2008 (7:48pm CST)
Tyger and I made an incredible find for this year's MFM! We're both really excited and started stockpiling as much as we can in the time allowed. Might have to grab some additional folks to help out, because this is amazing. Here I thought we only had one shot at making this happen, but turns out we've got a lot more time than we figured. Really as much as we want now that I think about it. *laugh* Will have to post more when I get the chance. Connection here's a bit spotty. It was really nice to see the ducks at the Holiday Inn again, even if they did look a bit confused when we showed up.

Thursday, July 21, 2011 (8:13pm CST)
Going over to Tyger's to discuss con setup. Not sure exactly what we'll do to kick things off, but something new would be good. How the heck do you do something better than a bunny suit on a motorcycle? We've both been wracking our brains on that one. Grabbing some dinner with him and we'll see where things go.

Thursday, July 21, 2011 (9:09pm CST)
HOLY CRAP! It IS bigger on the inside!

Wednesday, August 24, 2011 (2:13am CST)
I hope my posts are getting through. Doc (he hates it when I call him that) says the connection should work, but it seems to hiccup every once in while. I emailed the site admins to find out why my posts are all over the place. Still have to finalize some scheduling items, but I really think it's going to be a good year. We've all found a lot of good stuff, but between the "Yatta!"s and the constant air guitars, it gets pretty noisy in here. I'm really still confused on the meeting we had with Mr. Price. Who would've guessed he'd know the Doc? Tyger really liked his roast turkey - it was amazing! Too bad there wasn't any left after we were through with it.


Labor Day Weekend 2011 - September 2 - 4

Yes, Welcome Home brings a very special meaning to this year's MFM!! We are please to now call The Whispering Woods Hotel & Conference Center our home.

See below for booking instructions and special information - You MUST book your room directly with the hotel!

We knew it was going to happen, the MFM official hotel has sold out!!! It looks like this will be a record year for MFM and with our new amazing hotel Whispering Woods, everyone wants to be a part of it!

I am in nearby Louisville, CO for a job interview and will be there until this Friday.  I'd love to meet any local furs in the area if there is an opportunity.  I can make it to the RMFC hotel tomorrow evening if need be.  Because my job interview was scheduled at the last minute, I was unable to make any plans to attend RMFC itself, but I figure that any local furs who are part of that con will be setting up tomorrow.

I'll see about showing up at the hotel just to hang out with the local furs for any pre-con gatherings before I have to fly home Friday afternoon.

Hi Folks

I have a problem I am trying to solve.  Hot Melt glue is a great product as
it's fast and easy to use.

However as I live in Australa  it can get pretty hot and I found a few times
that the glue had softened when the parts were being transported in the car.

What can you recommend as a substitute

Many thanks
Marc

U could try putting it in the fridge or freezer once you get home then get
them out about half hour before you plan on working on ur project and let
them get to room temperature. Hope this helps.

Hi

Over 70 C Hot Glue gets soft.
with 100 C ist starts sticking again

best is you store your suit in a Big Esky Box or Aloi Zarges Box.
All so great are GFK Boxes of the Army.

Regards

From cool but in summer 10 Days hot mid Europe (This year max. 37 C with 85%
humidity)

Hi everybody.
i just wanted to officially introduce myself to everyone.
My name is Jake. I live in Rhode Island. You can also call me Shadow.
My Fursona is Connor Rafe.
I'll give a bit of a description of Connor here: so you all can get an idea of what he looks like. Connor is a genetically altered wolf. he has 3 tails and his main colors are black with a gray underbelly, a blue almost turquoise stripe down his back (and the same color blue on the insides of his ears) and brown hair on top of his head. he has deep blue eyes which (when i make his head) will glow in the dark. despite being a genetic experiment for most of his life he's upbeat and a bit of an innocent and a lovable spazz. i still have to work out his markings but my girlfriend and i shall be doing that tomorrow afternoon
anyways thanks for taking the time to read this and i look forward to many good memories as a part of the fandom.
if you have any questions or comments please don't hesitate to message me.
thanks again
~Connor

There are 3 "temperatures" of Hot Glue: Low Temperature (Melts at
260?F - 127?C) and High Temperature (Melts at 380?F - 193?C).
Multitemp Hot Glue generally softens/melts at the same temperature as
low-temp hot glue.

If you're having issues with your Hot Glue softening in the sun, it
may be worth the investment to purchase and use a high-temp Hot Glue
gun and sticks instead.

JB Weld is not recommended for most fursuit work unless you know what
you're doing, as incorrectly mixed patches can become damaging both to
material and skin. Also, you never want to use JB Weld in a fursuit
head, as it can outgass (put off vapors) even long after it's
solidified that can be harmful to people if directly concentrated and
inhaled, such conditions as you may find in an enclosed fursuit head.

Your local hobby/crafts store, or online shop should have high-temp
hot glue materials and equipment for sale.

I would not use J.B. Weld for any fursuit application for another
reason. From my experience it has always failed to hold. I do not
think that its as good of a product as the manufacturer claims. I have
found that the types of superglue that I have used to work far better.

Hi Folks

Thanks for all of the comments but I am afraid you are missing the main
point.  If the glue softens at a temperature that would be normal in our
climate.. What happens when the suit is in a suitcase waiting to be loaded
on a plane, or sitting in the plane's hold on the runway.

 

Its just not possible to protect the suit in a controlled climate all of the
time and it will be times like transporting on conventions etc where it will
be at the most risk

 

Many thanks for all comments

Marcwolf

I use M3 supper 77 spray glue and I have tried different types of
superglues. None of which are affected all that much by temperatures
that you would normally find even in the hottest boot of a car.

If it's foam rubber and/or fur, something porous, you can't go wrong
with Super 77.  If it's plastic mesh that you're trying to hold
together, go with something akin to its intended purpose and hold them
together with zip ties, strong yarn, or twine.

On my plastic mesh heads I used leather yarn. Leather yarn is a very
thick like yarn and is imbedded with wax. Its used in working with
saddles and other riding tack. I used it just like sowing fabric. I
think that it came out quite well.

Hi there, not sure if I've posted to this list before! Name's Foxfairy.

Anyway, as for a suggestion - E6000 is an "industrial" adhesive that can be
found at most hardware stores (at least in the US, probably in Australia
too) in a caulking size tube. Smaller tubes are available online. It's a
very strong glue,  holds up well to high temperatures, and doesn't have a
very strong smell.

Often I will use hot glue to prototype things.  And to hold wires in place.
Hi-temp hot melt sounds good is I can get it.

 

Many thanks

+2 on the hi-temp hot melt glue. It's good for prototyping.

JB Weld on the other hand, is a weldable epoxy. It takes a good 24 hours
for it to set properly at room temperature. It'll take a minimum of six
hours for it to stop being tacky. It has incredible strength when it sets,
and is good for bonding metals in applications where there is not a lot of
shear stress. However it's not for fabrics. If an epoxy is to be used, a
better one is 5-minute epoxy, mixed in small batches. It cures in an
off-white color over the course of ....five minutes. Then it's solid after
an hour. I've used both for non-costume apps and never experienced any
outgassing once cured.

3M Super 77 is great stuff - I've used it for the restoration of
headliners and for the interior work on a snowmobile cutter sleigh; I've
used it for bonding closed cell neoprene foam to create seat padding and
the stuff is terrific, so long as your surfaces are dry & clean. You can
either spray one surface for moderate adhesion, or spray both surfaces and
let set for sixty seconds before sticking them together for super
adhesion.  It does, however have issues with overspray making everything
around it feel tacky, so watch out and be careful with your management of
overspray by masking off the parts you don't want getting stuck. The Super
cleans up with mineral spirits when fresh, and requires increasingly
aggressive solvents the longer you let it cure.

HTH,

There is also jb quick I use that stuff more often but it does not last as long in the tube nor working time it cures in less then an hour.
Also super 77 is the best stuff I have seen for bonding fabric to surfaces shake, spray one side,spray the other, wait, push together and hold for 30 seconds

hi folks... i have a couple of n00b questions.

I've been searching around online for a way to dye white synthetic fur dark colors. I've found Beetlecat's tutorial (http://beetlecat.livejournal.com/188117.html) and I've found the sharpie method (http://fursuit.livejournal.com/2826105.html). my questions are this: Are there other methods that can be used?Which method gives the most success for dark colors?Which is best for durability?Which are best for markings?Which is best for giving the most vibrant color?
my other question regards UV reactive paint. i'm thinking of using as a sort of top coat for Connor's markings so they're visible during raves. what's the best paint to use, can it be applied the same way as beetlecat's method above and what is the best way to apply it in an intricate design?
thanks in advance for your help,
~Connor *wags tails*

I was wondering if any other fursuiter seems to have phantom tail syndrome?

For some odd reason when I sit down I try to move my tail out of the way so
I will not sit on it. The problem is that I am not wearing a tail to move
out of the way. I am finding this odd and some what disturbing.

Yep..
And even worse is phantom suit syndrome. You've spent a day in the suit
running around entertaining kids by smiling and waving at them.. Which if
fun when it's done by a big friendly wolf.

However when its done by a middle aged man it's totally different.

Take Care

  I was wondering if any other fursuiter seems to have phantom tail
syndrome?

  For some odd reason when I sit down I try to move my tail out of the way
so I will not sit on it. The problem is that I am not wearing a tail to move
out of the way. I am finding this odd and some what disturbing.

Hahaha oh man Have I experienced that before ^^  For a time I used to  
"hold my tail" while scooting between my chair and coworker's desk  
(so I wouldn't knock pictures and coffee cups off) and he was like  
"dude, what are you doing with your hand like that??"
I've also had phantom horn too ;)

Yes hehehehe I was wearing mine all weekend and forgot I had it on a few
times. Or I would start swinging my tail and then realize I don't have my
tail on. I told my roomies I'm just going to wear it full time so problems
don't persist.

I'm a fursuiter and I not just experience phantom tail, but I also experience phantom body syndrome because the wolf suit that I have is my actual body, and when I take it off, I kinda still feel like I still have it on me, that goes the same for tail that I have when I'm not wearing the suit. I also feel phantom limbs, like feet, tail, head, name it and I feel that phantom thing. That is how you can tell that your a true furry.

Nice progress, Marc.
I've got an eye lid that blinks sitting here on the top of my computer; I
am still working on the controls and also need to figure out a mounting
system. I'm trying to work out the mechanicals for a composite frame which
is generalized enough that it could be embedded in multiple head
configurations. The controller that I am using will support six servos, so
I could probably use it for other things like ears as well. Progress has
slowed way down though as I am picking up an unexpected (and unrelated)
second job which may keep me quite busy for the next twelve months! (Email
off-list for the details)

 Movable cameras, based on servo control & a range finding circuit; Now
that's kind of neat. I will be interested to hear how it works in real
life.

I think it's actually a cute idea!  It's kinda like.. going back to
the basics of furry without it being furry.
Also, it seems like it might be a good kind of therapy.. you notice
how different you feel when you're behind the suit...  I kinda wish
overly shy people would give it a try more often, furry or not.

1.FC:Unleashed 2012 Call for Act Submissions!
HEYYYYYYYY!

It's that time again!

It's me, Sprout! Your FC:Unleashed 2012 Lead and MC! And with me again, is Humble! Your dedicated 2nd and Co-MC! :)

We're looking forward to another FANTASTIC year putting on another FANTASTIC show for all you awesome folks! :)

Some things to look forward to for 2012:

- Bigger, Better prizes! $250 for first place!

- A new judging category! That's right! That makes 4 chances to win!

- The owners of Psycho Donuts will be returning as Judges!

- A bigger staff working on the show, which means more awesome!

- A longer show! We're going for a FULL 2 hours this time! :) YAY!

- And finally, more seating because it's going to be at the CONVENTION CENTER! YAH!

We're already working on some big things for the show next year but there's one thing that we need above all else to make the show a success, YOU and YOUR ACTS!

So, Humble and I put together this little inspirational video for you to watch so hopefully get those creative juices flowing!
http://youtu.be/DkUiqDS4j3M 

In order to submit an act, we need the following:

Name of the group:
Names of Group Members/Number of Group Members:
Contact information:
Length of Act:
Description of Act:
Will your act require music or be a video?:
Do you want your act to be submitted for judging?:
Any special needs/props:
What type of lighting do you need (pitch black stage at the beginning/end, etc.)?

PLEASE SEND AS MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE!

This form is VERY important to us for the planning of the show schedule, rehearsals, staying in touch with you, etc.

All submission forms, questions, etc. can be sent to: fcu at furtherconfusion.org

If you are interested in working as one of our stage crew or are interested in submitting an act idea or just want to be in a skit but don't have an idea of your own, please feel free to e-mail us!

The deadline to submit acts is 12/31/2011 at Midnight!

We now officially have our own YouTube channel! Yay!

You can see our past videos and any that we put up at: http://www.youtube.com/user/furconunleashed

Also! We have a twitter account for the show! It's a great resource for show updates and information! Our twitter is: www.twitter.com/fc_unleashed

And if you'd like to contact us at all our e-mail is: fcu at furtherconfusion.org

We look forward to hearing from folks and seeing the great acts people will be submitting! Please remember, without you guys submitting content for the show, it's just Humble and myself on stage being ridiculous for two hours or an entire show of our obnoxious humor translated into videos and acts, and no one wants to see that.... trust me...

:)

Thank you for taking the time to read this! Have a great day!

2. Wise words from our Chair

Hello all.

We are now entering into the home stretch now more than ever we need your best efforts. Look at your responsibilities, is anything behind? are you waiting on another department? are there issues that need to be dealt with before you can go forward? This is the time to address these issues. October and most of November is the time we really need to finalize. Its hard to get peoples attention during the holiday season. After the holiday season what you need may be too late or in extreme crisis. So there is no more time to put things off. If you need help, for goodness sake ask! Many of you on my staff are getting your first taste of running a furry convention, so don't think you need to go at it alone. Me and my exec staff are here to help in any way possible. But we cant help if we don't know there is problem. 

You are all wonderful, thank you for your efforts so far.

Warm Regards
Bosn C Otter
Chairman

3.Badge Art Wanted!

Further Confusion is currently seeking artwork submissions for the 2012 membership badge inserts. Both color and black & white artwork will be accepted, and all artwork will be considered on overall 'look and feel', plus these additional points:

- Size: Art must scale to be printed at 4" wide x 2" tall.
- Theme: Art must accurately reflect the theme of the con.
- Age appropriateness: The art must be suitable for viewing by children.
- Branding: 'FC', 'FurCon' or 'Further Confusion' and the convention year, '2012', must be present.

Artists submitting images should be aware that there is no payment for badge art chosen, and the artist gives Further Confusion the right to reproduce the image in the con program book and as badge art for FC2012. The artist will be credited on the insert and in the con program book. The artist retains all other copyrights and reproduction rights beyond the above.

Submission deadline is November 1st, 2011. All qualifying submissions will be seriously considered and 6 designs will be chosen for use. All artists will be notified by December 1st as to whether or not their submissions have been chosen.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

4.Conbook LAST CHANCE FOR ARTISTS AND WRITERS!

some places left that you can purchase to sell your wares in. Head on over to the

Furry Market Place page on the Further Confusion website for all the details and

restrictions.

If you want to speed the process up a little, and you know for sure you are

coming to the convention, with or without having a space to sell things, then go

pre-register first. Doing so will make the whole purchase of a space go a whole

lot faster.

FMP page on the FC 2012 Website:
http://www.furtherconfusion.org/fc2012/dealers/marketplace



See section #3 above about the main badge art. Dealers Room and Furry Market Place are ALSO looking for your artwork for the Dealer Badges, Dealer Assistant Tags, Furry Market Place tags and Furry Market Place Assistant Tags.

Most of the above is cribbed from section #3 above, but there are some differences. They will be considered in the same manner as the main badges, but more with a look towards being good for the Dealers and Furry Market Place vendors.

- Size: Art must scale to be printed at 3.5" wide x 2" tall (size of a standard US Business card).
- Theme: Art must accurately reflect the theme of the con PLUS be suggestive of things being sold (think 'Gift Shop' and NOT 'organ legging' or anything drug-related).
- Age appropriateness: The art must be suitable for viewing by children.
- Branding MAY be present in the form of 'FC', 'FurCon' or 'Further Confusion' and the convention year, '2012'. But they are NOT required. If you do NOT include branding, they WILL be added and may obscure some of your work if you do not leave space for such.
- The area in the bottom center of the artwork (approximately 1/4th to 1/3rd inch tall) will likely become obscured by the dealer/vendor badge information, please keep this in mind in your design, solid shades of a single color are recommended in this space, or leaving it 'white'.

As with the badges for main membership, artists submitting images should be aware that there is no payment for badge art chosen, and the artist gives Further Confusion the right to reproduce the image as badge art for FC2012. The badge art MAY or MAY NOT also see reproduction in the con program book. The artist will be credited on the Dealer Flyer and in the con program book if the art also appears there. The artist retains all other copyrights and reproduction rights beyond the above.

As with the art for the main membership badge inserts, submission deadline is November 1st, 2011. All qualifying submissions will be seriously considered and up to 4 designs will be chosen for use. All artists will be notified by December 1st as to whether or not their submissions have been chosen.

Submissions should be in JPG format at best possible quality compression, 300 DPI (1000x600 pixels) minimum. An 7" by 4" original scanned at 300 DPI produces a good file to work with. Badge art submissions should be sent to <dealers at furtherconfusion.org>. It is better to place a LINK in the email to the art for download rather than attaching the file to the email as this email address is NOT configured to allow large files to be attached, unlike the email address presented for the main con badge art submissions. In the email, specify your website (if you want it listed) and how you wish to be credited should your art be chosen.

Please note: Do not submit the same art to both submissions email addresses. And do not send dealer badge art submissions to the non-dealer email address.

Message-ID: <f008fbe7ed2c6007fe8c95fde8ca033a.squirrel@emailmg.startlogic.com>

What are the tradeoffs and advantages of these methods of head construction?

Head based on:
Bike helmet, with foam / fiberglass modification
Baseball cap, with foam buildup
Balaclava-based head design with either foam or latex form from a mold
Plastic grid fabric underlayment with foam/fabric

What I am interested in knowing is what are the advantages to each in
terms of

comfort, in terms of fit, weight distribution as well as ventilation

Shape retention in case of rough house activity, clowning, athletics,
comedy & martial arts demos

Weight distribution on the head, face & shoulders

construction difficulty & labor requirement

-- When you are making costumes, do you tend to choose one head
construction technique and stick with it, or do you switch, depending on
the application?

-- When wearing a costume, do you have a preference in terms of which
construction technique you like to wear versus another?

I haven't given up yet, even though it's been two years. Maybe by the end
of 2012 we'll have something. I'd like to get it right on the first try
since I might only have one shot at this.

I've got a blue M laboratory oven in which a whole head can be placed and
heated evenly to a precision temperature. If a buck can be made from
plaster or maybe fiberglass, then maybe the form could be created from
this fosshape. The form could then have a couple of cross-pieces placed
within the jaw & cheek area to further triangulate the structure, then
stuffed with batting in the necessary places. That ought to make it tough
and lightweight. I may try & get some pieces to see how stiff & resilient
it is to bending. Ultimately I'd think a relatively stiff material that
could then also get deformed & have it spring back into shape would be the
way to go. Brian's going to send me a 5 x 7 sample to experiment with.

Message-ID: <1edcc20bad308952542af068bae86060.squirrel@emailmg.startlogic.com>

I need to find a good set of shoes for use with the costume. They need to
be black, and they need to be secure, but also slip-on. I want EVERYTHING.
I want to them to be comfortable, light, good for a few hours of strolling
about, and importantly, be good for doing jumps, cartwheels, and martial
arts kicks.

I am thinking of something like a martial arts shoe, but they are all
generally low-tops. I found something like a neoprene & mesh water shoe on
Amazon that is designed for outdoor sporting activities as diverse as
dance to scuba, and at $34 they don't seem too expensive. If you have a
suggestion on your favorite shoe for making costume feet, let me know.

Here's a few links to my front-runners, (pun intended)

http://www.amazon.com/Bold-Leather-Martial-Arts-Shoes/dp/B003TTB2M4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1320935968&sr=8-4

http://www.amazon.com/Macho-Martial-Arts-Comet-Shoes/dp/B000YC5JT6/ref=pd_sim_sbs_sg_4

This one has me particularly intrigued:
http://www.amazon.com/ZemGear-Playa-High-Barefoot-Metallic/dp/B004WQNFXC/ref=pd_sbs_shoe_31

Of course, Amazon isn't the only game in town but it offers handy links.

I could use some help on picking from someone who has already walked this
path.

--
On the matter of gloves, I have to get some black gloves for the basis of
the paw, and since I've gotten four sets of Ironclad gloves in the past,
I'd have to say it's my hands-down favorite. So I think the gloves I'll
pick up will be another set of Ironclad.

These things are awesome, though they are a little short up-top. Nothing
that some sewing won't fix, I am sure! However the finger pads are
terrific and it's like putting on a second skin.

2.  Last chance badge submissions

Further Confusion is currently seeking artwork submissions for the 2012 membership badge inserts. Both color and black and white artwork will be accepted, and all artwork will be considered on overall 'look and feel', plus these additional points:

- Size: Art must scale to be printed at 4" wide x 2" tall.
- Theme: Art must accurately reflect the theme of the con.
- Age appropriateness: The art must be suitable for viewing by children.
- Branding: 'FC', 'FurCon' or 'Further Confusion' and the convention year, '2012', must be present.

Artists submitting images should be aware that there is no payment for badge art chosen, and the artist gives Further Confusion the right to reproduce the image in the con program book and as badge art for FC2012. The artist will be credited on the insert and in the con program book. The artist retains all other copyrights and reproduction rights beyond the above.

Submission deadline was November 1st, 2011. We are atill considering late submissions with the policy of the sooner we get it the greater the chance of it being used. All qualifying submissions will be seriously considered and 6 designs will be chosen for use. All artists will be notified by December 1st as to whether or not their submissions have been chosen.

Submissions should be in JPG format at best possible quality compression, 300 DPI (1200x600 pixels) minimum. An 8" by 4" original scanned at 300 DPI produces a good file to work with.

We're already working on some big things for the show next year but there's one thing that we need above all else to make the show a success, YOU and YOUR ACTS!

So, our FC:U! leads have put together this little inspirational video for you to watch so hopefully get those creative juices flowing! <http://youtu.be/NjU8imxO0zg>

In order to submit an act, we need the following:

- Name of the group
- Names of Group Members/Number of Group Members
- Contact information
- Length of Act
- Description of Act
- Will your act require music or be a video?
- Do you want your act to be submitted for judging?
- Any special needs/props
- What type of lighting do you need (pitch black stage at the beginning/end, etc.)?

PLEASE SEND AS MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE!

This form is VERY important to us for the planning of the show schedule, rehearsals, staying in touch with you, etc.

All submission forms, questions, etc. can be sent to: fcu-2012 at furtherconfusion.org

Also, all of this information is on the YouTube video if you click on the, "Show More" button underneath the video.

If you are interested in working as one of our stage crew or are interested in submitting an act idea or just want to be in a skit but don't have an
idea of your own, please feel free to e-mail us!

The deadline to submit acts is midnight at the end of December 31st, 2011.

We now officially have our own YouTube channel! Yay!

You can see our past videos and any that we put up at: <http://www.youtube.com/user/furconunleashed>

Also! We have a twitter account for the show! It's a great resource for show updates and information! Our twitter is: <http://twitter.com/fc_unleashed>


We look forward to hearing from folks and seeing the great acts people will be submitting! Please remember, without you guys submitting content for the show, it's just Humble and Sprout on stage being ridiculous for two hours or an entire show of our obnoxious humor translated into videos and acts, and no one wants to see that.... trust us...
